               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Λητώ</span>), in Latin <span style="font-variant: small-caps">LATONA</span>, according to Hesiod (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 406</span>, <span class="bibl">921</span>), a daughter of the Titan Coeus and Phoebe, a sister of Asteria, and the mother of
                  Apollo and Artemis by Zeus, to whom she was married before Hera. Homer, who likewise
                  calls her the mother of Apollo and Artemis by Zeus (<span class="bibl">Il. 1.9</span>, <span class="bibl">14.327</span>, <span class="bibl">21.499</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 11.318</span>, <span class="bibl">580</span>), <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e98">[Page 773]</span> mentions her as the friend of the Trojans in the war with the Greeks, and in the
                  story of' Niobe, who paid so dearly for her conduct towards Leto. (
               <span class="biblfree">Il. 5.447</span>,
               <span class="biblfree">20.40</span>,
               <span class="biblfree">72</span>,
               <span class="biblfree">24.607</span>,
               <span>; comp. 21.502, </span>
               <span class="biblfree">Od. 11.580</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Apoll.</span> 45, &amp;c., 89, &amp;c.) In later writers these elements of her story are variously worked
                  out and embellished, for they do not describe her as the lawful wife of Zeus, but
                  merely as a concubine, who was persecuted during her pregnancy by Hera. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.4.1</span>; Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Del.</span> 61, &amp;c.; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Eurip. Phoen.</span> 232, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 140</span>.) All the world being afraid of receiving her on account of Hera, she wandered about
                  till she came to the island of Delos, which was then a floating island, and bore the
                  name Asteria (Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Dian.</span> 35, 37, 191); but when Leto touched it, it suddenly stood still upon four pillars.
                  (Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">Fragm.</span> 38; <span class="bibl">Strab. xi. p.485</span>.) According to Hyginus (<span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 93</span>,140), Delos was previously called Ortygia, while Stephanus Byzantinus (<span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Κορισσός</span>) mentions a tradition, according to which Artemis was not born in Delos, but at Corissus.
                  Servius (<span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 3.72</span>) relates the following legends: Zeus changed Leto into a quail (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ὄρτυξ</span>), and in this state she arrived in the floating island, which was hence called Ortygia;
                  or, Zeus was enamoured with Asteria, but she being metamorphosed, through her prayers,
                  into a bird, flew across the sea; she was then changed into a rock, which, for a long
                  time, lay under the surface of the sea; but, at the request of Leto, it rose and received
                  Leto, who was pursued by Python. Leto then gave birth to Apollo, who slew Python.
                  (Comp. <span class="bibl">Ant. Lib. 35</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 6.370</span>; <span class="bibl">Aristot. HA 6.35</span>; <span class="bibl">Ath. 15.701</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 2.707</span>; Iamblich. <span style="font-style: italic">Vit. Pyth.</span> 10; <span class="bibl">Strab. xiv. p.639</span>: in each of these passages we find the tradition modified in a particular way.) But
                  notwithstanding the many discrepancies, especially in regard to the place where Leto
                  gave birth to her children, most traditions agree in describing Delos as the place.
                  (Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Apoll.</span> init. 59, <span style="font-style: italic">in Del.</span> 206, 261; Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Eum.</span> 9; <span class="bibl">Hdt. 2.170</span>.) After the birth of Apollo, his mother not being able to nurse him, Themis gave
                  him nectar and ambrosia; and by his birth the island of Delos became sacred, so that
                  henceforth it was not lawful for any human being to be born or to die on the island;
                  and every pregnant woman was conveyed to the neighbouring island of Rheneia, in order
                  not to pollute Delos. (<span class="bibl">Strab. x. p.486</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>We shall pass over the various speculations of modern writers respecting the origin
                  and nature of this divinity, and shall mention only the most probable, according to
                  which Leto is " the obscure " or " concealed," not as a physical power, but as a divinity
                  yet quiescent and invisible, from whom is issued the visible divinity with all his
                  splendour and brilliancy. This view is supported by the account of her genealogy given
                  by Hesiod; and her whole legend seems to indicate nothing else but the issuing from
                  darkness to light, and a return from the latter to the former. Leto was generally
                  worshipped only in conjunction with her children, as at Megara (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.44.2</span>), at Argos (2.21.10), at Amphigeneia (<span class="bibl">Strab. viii. p.349</span>), in Lycia (ibid. xiv. p. 665), near Lete in Macedonia (Steph. Byz. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Λήτη</span>), in a grove near Calynda in Caria (<span class="bibl">Strab. xiv. p.651</span>), and other places. (Comp. Hirt. <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> Tab. 5.4.)
