               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Ἀμφιτρίτη</span>), according to Hesiod (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 243</span>) and Apollodorus (<span class="bibl">1.2.7</span>) a Nereid, though in other places Apollodorus (<span class="bibl">1.2.2</span>, <span class="bibl">1.4.5</span>) calls her an Oceanid. She is represented as the wife of Poseidon and the goddess
                  of the sea (the Mediterranean), and she is therefore a kind of female Poseidon. In
                  the Homeric poems she does not occur as a goddess, and Amphitrite is merely the name
                  of the sea. The most ancient passages in which she occurs as a real goddess is that
                  of Hesiod above referred to and the Homeric hymn on the Delian Apollo (94), where
                  she is represented as having been present at the birth of Apollo. When Poseidon sued
                  for her hand, she fled to Atlas, but her lover sent spies after her, and among them
                  one Delphinus, who brought about the marriage between her and Poseidon, and the grateful
                  god rewarded his service by placing him among the stars. (Eratosth. <span style="font-style: italic">Catast.</span> 31; Hygin. <span style="font-style: italic">Poet. Astr.</span> 2.17.) When afterwards Poseidon shewed some attachment to Scylla, Amphitrite's jealousy
                  was excited to such a degree, that she threw some magic herbs into the well in which
                  Scylla used to bathe, and thereby changed her rival into a monster with six heads
                  and twelve feet. (Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph.</span> 45, 649.) She became by Poseidon the mother of Triton, Rhode, or Rhodos, and Benthesicyme.
                  (Hesiod. <span style="font-style: italic">Theoy.</span> 930, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.4.5</span>; <span class="bibl">3.15.4</span>.) Later poets regard Amphitrite as the goddess of the sea in general, or the ocean.
                  (<span class="bibl">Eur. Cycl. 702</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 1.14</span>.) Amphitrite was frequently represented in ancient works of art; her figure resembled
                  that of Aphrodite, but she was usually distinguished from her by a sort of net which
                  kept her hair together, and by the claws of a crab on her forehead. She was sometimes
                  represented as riding on marine animals, and sometimes as drawn by them. The temple
                  of Poseidon on the Corinthian isthmus contained a statue of Amphitrite (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.1.7</span>), and her figure appeared among the relief ornaments of the temple of Apollo at Amyclae
                  (3.19.4). on the throne of the Olympian Zeus, and in other places. (5.2.3, comp. 1.17.3,
                  5.26.2.) We still possess a considerable number of representations of Amphitrite.
                  A colossal statue of her exists in the Villa Albani, and she frequently appears on
                  coins of Syracuse. The most beautiful specimen extant is that on the arch of Augustus
                  at Rimini. (Winckelmann, <span style="font-style: italic">Alte Denkmäler,</span> 1.36; Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderbuch,</span> ii. p. 159.)
