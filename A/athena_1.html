               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Ἀθήνη</span> or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀθηνᾶ</span>), one of the great divinities of the Greeks. Homer <span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 5.880</span>) calls her a daughter of Zeus, without any allusion to her mother or to the manner
                  in which she was called into existence, while most of the later traditions agree in
                  stating that she was born from the head of Zeus. According to Hesiod (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 886</span>, &amp;c.), Metis, the first wife of Zeus, was the mother of Athena, but when Metis was
                  pregnant with her, Zeus, on the advice of Gaea and Uranus, swallowed Metis up, and
                  afterwards gave birth himself to Athena, who sprang from his head. (Hesiod, <span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span> 924.) Pindar <span class="bibl">Pind. O. 7.35</span>, &amp;c.) adds, that Hephaestus split the head of Zeus with his axe, and that Athena
                  sprang forth with a mighty war-shout. Others relate, that Prometheus or Hermes or
                  Palamaon assisted Zeus in giving birth to Athena, and mentioned the river Triton as
                  the place where the event took place. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.4.5</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind. Ol.</span> 7.66.) Other traditions again relate, that Athena sprang from the head of Zeus in
                  frill armour, a statement for which Stesichorus is said to have been the most ancient
                  authority. (Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph.</span> 355; Philostr. <span style="font-style: italic">Icon.</span> 2.27; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Apollon.</span> 4.1310.) All these traditions, however, agree in making Athena a daughter of Zeus;
                  but a second set regard her as the daughter of Pallas, the winged giant, whom she
                  afterwards killed on account of his attempting to violate her chastity, whose skin
                  <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e105">[Page 398]</span> she used as her aegis, and whose wings she fastened to her own feet. (Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph. l.c.;</span> Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor.</span> 3.23.) A third tradition carries us to Libya, and calls Athena a daughter of Poseidon
                  and Tritonis. Athena, says Herodotus (<span class="bibl">4.180</span>), on one occasion became angry with her father and went to Zeus, who made her his
                  own daughter. This passage shews more clearly than any other the manner in which genuine
                  and ancient Hellenic myths were transplanted to Libya, where they were afterwards
                  regarded as the sources of Hellenic ones. Respecting this Libyan Athena, it is farther
                  related, that she was educated by the rivergod Triton, together with his own daughter
                  Pallas. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.12.3</span>.) In Libya she was also said to have invented the flute; for when Perseus had cut
                  off the head of Medusa, and Stheno and Euryale, the sisters of Medusa, lamented her
                  death, while plaintive sounds issued from the mouths of the serpents which surrounded
                  their heads, Athena is said to have imitated these sounds on a reed. (<span class="bibl">Pind. P. 12.19</span>, &amp;c.; compare the other accounts in <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 165</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.4.2</span> ; <span class="bibl">Paus. 1.24.1</span>.) The connexion of Athena with Triton and Tritonis caused afterwards the various
                  traditions about her birth-place, so that wherever there was a river or a well of
                  that name, as in Crete, Thessaly, Boeotia, Arcadia, and Egypt, the inhabitants of
                  those districts asserted that Athena was born there. It is from such birth-places
                  on a river Triton that she seems to have been called Tritonis or Tritogeneia (<span class="bibl">Paus. 9.33.5</span>), though it should be observed that this surname is also explained in other ways;
                  for some derive it from an ancient Cretan, Aeolic, or Boeotian word, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">τριτώ</span>, signifying " head," so that it would mean " the goddess born from the head," and
                  others think that it was intended to commemorate the circumstance of her being born
                  on the third day of the month. (Tztez. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph.</span> 519.) The connexion of Athena with Triton naturally suggests, that we have to look
                  for the most ancient seat of her worship in Greece to the banks of the river Triton
                  in Boeotia, which emptied itself into lake Copais, and on which there were two ancient
                  Pelasgian towns, Athenae and Eleusis, which were according to tradition swallowed
                  up by the lake. From thence her worship was carried by the Minyans into Attica, Libya,
                  and other countries. (Müller, <span style="font-style: italic">Orchom.</span> p. 355.) We must lastly notice one tradition, which made Athena a daughter of Itonius
                  and sister of Iodama, who was killed by Athena (<span class="bibl">Paus. 9.34.1</span>; Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph.</span> 355), and another according to which she was the daughter of Hephaestus.
               </p> 
               <p>These various traditions about Athena arose, as in most other cases, from local legends
                  and from identifications of the Greek Athena with other divinities. The common notion
                  which the Greeks entertained about her, and which was most widely spread in the ancient
                  world, is, that she was the daughter of Zeus, and if we take Metis to have been her
                  mother, we have at once the clue to the character which she bears in the religion
                  of Greece ; for, as her father was the most powerful and her mother the wisest among
                  the gods, so Athena was a combination of the two, that is, a goddess in whom power
                  and wisdom were harmoniously blended. From this fundamental idea may be derived the
                  various aspects under which she appears in the ancient writers. She seems to have
                  been a divinity of a purely ethical character, and not the representative of any particular
                  physical power manifested in nature; her power and wisdom appear in her being the
                  protectress and preserver of the state and of social institutions. Everything, therefore,
                  which gives to the state strength and prosperity, such as agriculture, inventions,
                  and industry, as well as everything which preserves and protects it from injurious
                  influence from without, such as the defence of the walls, fortresses, and harbours,
                  is under her immediate care.
               </p> 
               <p>As the protectress of agriculture, Athena is represented as the inventor of the plough
                  and rake: she created the olive tree, the greatest blessing of Attica, taught the
                  people to yoke oxen to the plough, took care of the breeding of horses, and instructed
                  men how to tame them by the bridle, her own invention. Allusions to this feature of
                  her character are contained in the epithets <span lang="grc" class="foreign">βούδεια</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">βοαρμία</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀλρίφα</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἱππία</span>, or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">χαλινῖτις</span>. (<span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1076</span>; Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph.</span> 520; Hesych. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἱππία</span>; <span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 4.402</span>; <span class="bibl">Pind. O. 13.79</span>.) At the beginning of spring thanks were offered to her in advance (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">προχαριστήρια</span>, Suid. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span>) for the protection she was to afford to the fields. Besides the inventions relating
                  to agriculture, others also connected with various kinds of science, industry, and
                  art, are ascribed to her, and all her inventions are not of the kind which men make
                  by chance or accident, but such as require thought and meditation. We may notice the
                  invention of numbers (<span class="bibl">Liv. 7.3</span>), of the trumpet (Böckh, <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind.</span> p. 344), the chariot, and navigation. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">AETHYIA.</span>] In regard to all kinds of useful arts, she was believed to have made men acquainted
                  with the means and instruments which are necessary for practising them, such as the
                  art of producing fire. She was further believed to have invented nearly every kind
                  of work in which women were employed, and she herself was skilled in such work : in
                  short Athena and Hephaestus were the great patrons both of the useful and elegant
                  arts. Hence she is called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἐργάνη</span> (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.24.3</span>), and later writers make her the goddess of all widom, knowledge, and art, and represent
                  her as sitting on the right hand side of her father Zeus, and supporting him with
                  her counsel. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Od.</span> xxiii 160, 18.190; <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Ven.</span> 4, 7, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Plut. Cim. 10</span>; Ovid, <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 3.833</span>; Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 31.8; Spanh. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Callim.</span> p. 643; <span class="bibl">Hor. Carm. 1.12</span>. 19; comp. <span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant.</span> under <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀθήναια</span> and <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Χαλκεῖα</span>.) As the goddess who made so many inventions necessary and useful in civilized life,
                  she is characterized by various epithets and surnames, expressing the keenness of
                  her sight or the power of her intellect, such as <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ὀπτιλέτις</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ὀφθαλμῖτις</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ὀξυδερκής</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">γλαυκῶπις</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">πολύβουλος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">πολύμητις</span>, and <span lang="grc" class="foreign">μηχανῖτις</span>.
               </p> 
               <p>As the patron divinity of the state, she was at Athens the protectress of the phratries
                  and houses which formed the basis of the state. The festival of the Apaturia had a
                  direct reference to this particular point in the character of the goddess. (<span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. v. Apaturia.</span>) She also maintained the authority of the law, and justice, and order, in the courts
                  and the assembly of the people. This notion was as ancient as the Homeric poems, in
                  which she is described as assisting Odysseus against the lawless conduct of the suitors.
                  (Od. 13.394.) She was believed to have instituted the ancient court of the Areiopagus,
                  and in cases where the votes of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e273">[Page 399]</span> the judges were equally diviled, she gave the casting one in favour of the accused.
                  (Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Eum.</span> 753; comp. <span class="bibl">Paus. 1.28.5</span>.) The epithets which have reference to this part of the goddess's character are <span lang="grc" class="foreign">άξιόποινος</span>, the avenger (<span class="bibl">Paus. 3.15.4</span>), <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Βουλαῖα</span>, and <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀγυραῖα</span>. (3.11.8.)
               </p> 
               <p>As Athena promoted the internal prosperity of the state, by encouraging agriculture
                  and industry, and by maintaining law and order in all public transactions, so also
                  she protected the state from outward enemies, and thus assumes the character of a
                  warlike divinity, though in a very different sense from Ares, Eris, or Enyo. According
                  to Homer (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 5.736</span>, &amp;c.), she does not even bear arms, but borrows them from Zeus; she keeps men from
                  slaughter when prudence demands it (Il. 1.199, &amp;c.), and repels Ares's savage love
                  of war, and conquers him. (5.840, &amp;c., 21.406.) She does not love war for its own
                  sake, but simply on account of the advantages which the state gains in engaging in
                  it; and she therefore supports only such warlike undertakings as are begun with prudence,
                  and are likely to be followed by favourable results. (10.244, &amp;c.) The epithets which
                  she derives from her warlike character are <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀγελεία</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">λαφρία</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀλκιμάχη</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">λαόσσοος</span>, and others. In times of war, towns, fortresses, and harbours are under her especial
                  care, whence she is designated as <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ερυσίπτολις</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀλαλκομενηΐς</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">πολιάς</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">πολιοῦχος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀκραῖα</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀκρία</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">κληδοῦχος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">πυλαῖτις</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">προμαχόρμα</span>, and the like. As the prudent goddess of war, she is also the protectress of all
                  heroes who are distinguished for prudence and good counsel, as well as for their strength
                  and valour, such as Heracles, Perseus, Bellerophontes, Achilles, Diomedes, and Odysseus.
                  In the war of Zeus against the giants, she assisted her father and Heracles with her
                  counsel, and also took an active part in it, for she buried Enceladus under the island
                  of Sicily, and slew Pallas. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.6.1</span>, &amp;c.; comp. Spanheim, <span style="font-style: italic">ad Callim.</span> p. 643; <span class="bibl">Hor. Carm. 1.12</span>. 19.) In the Trojan war she sided with the more civilised Greeks, though on their
                  return home she visited them with storms, on account of the manner in which the Locrian
                  Ajax had treated Cassandra in her temple. As a goddess of war and the protectress
                  of heroes, Athena usually appears in armour, with the aegis and a golden staff, with
                  which she bestows on her favourites youth and majesty. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 16.172</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>The character of Athena, as we have here traced it, holds a middle place between the
                  male and female, whence she is called in an Orphic hymn (31.10) <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἄρσην καὶ θῆλυς</span>, and hence also she is a virgin divinity (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 9.3), whose heart is inaccessible to the passion of love, and who shuns matrimonial
                  connexion. Teircsias was deprived of his sight for having seen her in the bath (Callim.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> pp. 546,589), and Hephaestus, who made an attempt upon her chastity, was obliged
                  to flee. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.6.7</span>, <span class="bibl">14.6</span>; <span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 2.547</span>, &amp;c.; comp. Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycophr.</span> 111.) For this reason, the ancient traditions always describe the goddess as dressed;
                  and when Ovid (<span class="bibl">Ov. Ep. 5.36</span>) makes her appear naked before Paris, he abandons the genuine old story. lier statue
                  also was always dressed, and when it was carried about at the Attic festivals, it
                  was entirely covered. But, notwithstanding the common opinion of her virgin character,
                  there are some traditions of late origin which describe her as a mother. Thus, Apollo
                  is called a son of Hephaestus and Athena--a legend which may have arisen at the time
                  when the Ionians introduced the worship of Apollo into Attica, and when this new divinity
                  was placed in some family connexion with the ancient goddess of the country. (Müller,
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Dor.</span> 2.2.13.) Lychnus also is called a son of Hephaestus and Athena. (Spanheim, <span style="font-style: italic">ad Callim.</span> p. 644.)
               </p> 
               <p>Athena was worshipped in all parts of Greece, and from the ancient towns on the lake
                  Copais her worship was nitroduced at a very early period into Attica, where she became
                  the great national divinity of the city and the country. Here she was afterwards regarded
                  as the <span lang="grc" class="foreign">θεὰ σώτειρα</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ὐγίεια</span>, and <span lang="grc" class="foreign">παιωνία</span>, and the serpent, the symbol of perpetual renovation, was sacred to her. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.23.5</span>, <span class="bibl">31.3</span>, <span class="bibl">2.4</span>.) At Lindus in Rhodes her worship was likewise very ancient. Respecting its introduction
                  into Italy, and the modifications which her character underwent there, see <span style="font-variant: small-caps">MINERVA.</span> Among the things sacred to her we may mention the owl, serpent, cock, and olive-tree,
                  which she was said to have created in her contest with Poseidon about the possession
                  of Attica. (Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de Is. et Os.;</span> <span class="bibl">Paus. 6.26.2</span>, <span class="bibl">1.24.3</span>; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 164</span>.) At Corone in Messenia her statue bore a crow in its hand. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 4.34.3</span>.) The sacrifices offered to her consisted of bulls, whence she probably derived the
                  surname of <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ταυροβόλος</span> (Suid. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span>), rams, and cows. (Hom. <span class="bibl">Il. 2.550</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 4.754</span>.) Eustathius (<span style="font-style: italic">ad Hom. l.c.</span>) remarks, that only female animals were sacrificed to her, but no female lambs. In
                  Ilion, Locrian maidens or children are said to have been sacrificed to her every year
                  as an atonement for the crime committed by the Locrian Ajax upon Cassandra; and Suidas
                  (<span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ποινή</span>) states, that these human sacrifices continued to be offered to her down to <span class="date">B. C. 346</span>. Respecting the great festivals of Athena at Athens, see <span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. vv. Panathenaea</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Arrhephoria.</span></p> 
               <p>Athena was frequently represented in works of art; but those in which her figure reached
                  the highest ideal of perfection were the three statues by Pheidias. The first was
                  the celebrated colossal statue of the goddess, of gold and ivory, which was erected
                  on the acropolis of Athens; the second was a still greater bronze statue, made out
                  of the spoils taken by the Athenians in the battle of Marathon; the third was a small
                  bronze statue called the beautiful or the Lemnian Athena, because it had been dedicated
                  at Athens by the Lemnians. The first of these statues represented the goddess in a
                  standing position, bearing in her hand a Nike four cubits in height. The shield stood
                  by her feet; her robe came down to her feet, on her breast was the head of Medusa,
                  in her right hand she bore a lance, and at her feet there lay a serpent. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.24.7</span>, <span class="bibl">28.2</span>.) We still possess a great number of representations of Athena in statues, colossal
                  busts, reliefs, coins, and in vase-paintings. Among the attributes which characterise
                  the goddess in these works of art, we mention--1. The helmet, which she usually wears
                  on her head, but in a few instances carries in her hand. It is usually ornamented
                  in the most beautiful manner with griffins, heads of rams, horses, and sphinxes. (Comp.
                  Hom. <span class="bibl">Il. 5.743</span>.) 2. The aegis. (<span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. v. Aegis.</span>) 3. The round Argolic shield. in the centre of which is represented the head of Medusa.
                  4. Objects sacred to her, such as an olive branch, a serpent, an owl, a cock, and
                  a lance. Her garment is usually the Spartan tunic without sleeves, and over it <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e476">[Page 400]</span> she wears a cloak, the peplus, or, though rarely, the chlamys. The general expression
                  of her figure is thoughtfulness and earnestness; her face is rather oval than round,
                  the hair is rich and generally combed backwards over the temples, and floats freely
                  down behind. The whole figure is majestic, and rather strong built than slender: the
                  hips are small and the shoulders broad, so that the whole somewhat resembles a male
                  figure. (Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> i. p. 46, &amp;c.; Welcker, <span style="font-style: italic">Zeitschrift für Gesch. der alten Kunst,</span> p. 256, &amp;c.)
