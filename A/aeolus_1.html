               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="persName">Αἴολος</span>). In the mythical history of Greece there are three personages of this name, who
                  are spoken of by ancient writers as connected with one another, but this connexion
                  is so confused, that it is impossible to gain a clear view of them. (Müller, <span style="font-style: italic">Orchom.</span> p. 138, &amp;c.) We shall follow Diodorus, who distinguishes between the three, although
                  in other passages he confounds them.

                  <h3><span class="head"><span lang="la" class="persName">Ae'olus</span></span></h3> 
                  <div id="smith-bio">aeolus-bio-1</div>
                  <p>1. A son of Hellen and the nymph Orseis, and a brother of Dorus and Xuthus. He is
                     described as the ruler of Thessaly, and regarded as the founder of the Aeolic branch
                     of the Greek nation. He married Enarete, the daughter of Deimachus, by whom he had
                     seven sons and five daughters, and according to some writers still more. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.7.3</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind. Pyth.</span> 4.190.) According to Müller's supposition, the most ancient and genuine story knew
                     only of four sons of Aeolus, viz. Sisyphus, Athamas, Cretheus, and Salmoneus, as the
                     representatives of the four main branches of the Aeolic race. The great extent of
                     country which this race occupied, and the desire of each part of it to trace its origin
                     to some descendant of Aeolus, probably gave rise to the varying accounts about the
                     number of his children. According to Hyginus (<span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 238</span>, <span class="bibl">242</span>) Aeolus had one son of the name of Macarcus, who, after having committed incest with
                     his sister Canace, put an end to his own life. According to Ovid (<span class="bibl">Ov. Ep. 11</span>) Aeolus threw the fruit of this love to the dogs, and sent his daughter a sword by
                     which she was to kill herself (Comp. Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Parallel.</span> p. 312.)

                  <h3><span class="head"><span lang="la" class="persName">Ae'olus</span></span></h3> 
                  <div id="smith-bio">aeolus-bio-2</div>
                  <p>2. Diodorus (<span class="bibl">4.67</span>) says, that the second Aeolus was the great-grandson of the first Aeolus, being the
                     son of Hippotes and Melanippe, and the grandson of Mimas the son of Aeolus. Arne,
                     the daughter of this second Aeolus, afterwards became mother of a third Aeolus. (Comp.
                     <span class="bibl">Paus. 9.40.3</span>.) In another passage (5.7) Diodorus represents the third Aeolus as a son of Hippotes.

                  <h3><span class="head"><span lang="la" class="persName">Ae'olus</span></span></h3> 
                  <div id="smith-bio">aeolus-bio-3</div>
                  <p>3. According to some accounts a son of Hippotes, or, according to others, of Poseidon
                     and Arne, the daughter of the second Aeolus. His story, which probably refers to thus
                     emigration of a branch of the Aeolians to the west, is thus related : Arne declared
                     to her father that she was with child by Poseidon, but her father disbelieving her
                     statement, gave her to a stranger of Metaponttum in Italy, who took her to his native
                     town. Here she became mother of two sons, Boeotus and Aeolus (iii.), who were adopted
                     by the man of Metapontum in accordance with an oracle. When they had grown up to manhood,
                     they took possession of the sovereignty of Metapontum by force. But when a dispute
                     afterwards arose between their mother Arne and their foster-mother Autolyte, the two
                     brothers slew the latter and fled with their mother front Metapontum. Aeolus went
                     to some islands in the Tyrrhenian sea, which received from him the name of the Aeolian
                     islands, and according to some accounts built the town of Lipara. <span class="bibl">Diod. 4.67. 5</span>.7. Here he reigned as a just and pious king, behaved kindly to the natives, and taught
                     them the use of sails in navigation, and foretold them from signs which he observed
                     in the fire the nature of the winds that were to rise. Hence, says Diodorus, Aeolus
                     is described in mythology as the ruler over the winds, and it was this Aeolus to whom
                     Odysseus came during his wanderings. A different account of the matter is given by
                     Hyginus. (<span style="font-style: italic">Fab.</span> 186.)
                  </p> 
                  <p>In these accounts Aeolus, the father of the Aeolian race, is placed in relationship
                     with Aeolus the ruler and god of the winds. The groundwork on which this connexion
                     has been formed by later poets and mythographers, is found in Homer. (<span class="bibl">Od. 10.2</span>, &amp;c.) In Homer, however, Aeolus, the son of Hippotes, is neither the god nor the
                     father of the winds, but merely the happy ruler of the Aeolian island, whom Cronion
                     had made the <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ταμίης</span> of the winds, which he might soothe or excite according to his pleasure. (<span class="bibl">Od. 10.21</span>, &amp;c.) This statement of Homer and the etymology of the name of Aeolus from <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀέλλω</span> were the cause, that in later times Aeolus was regarded as the god and king of the
                     winds, which he kept enclosed in a mountain. It is therefore to him that Juno applies
                     when she wishes to destroy the fleet of the Trojans. (<span class="bibl">Verg. A. 1.78</span>.) The Aeolian island of Homer was in the time of Pausanias believed to be Lipara
                     (<span class="bibl">Paus. 10.11.3</span>), and this or Strongyle was accordingly regarded in later times as the place in which
                     the god of the winds dwelled. (<span class="bibl">Verg. A. 8.416</span>, <span class="bibl">1.52</span>; <span class="bibl">Strab. vi. p.276</span>.) Other accounts place the residence of Aeolus in Thrace (<span class="bibl">Apollon. 1.954</span>, <span class="bibl">4.765</span>; Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymm. in Del.</span> 26), or in the neighbourhood of Rhegium in Italy. (Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycophr.</span> 732; comp. <span class="bibl">Diod. 5.8</span>.) The following passages of later poets also shew how universally Aeolus had gradually
                     come to be regarded as a god: <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 1.264</span>, <span class="bibl">11.748</span> 14.223; <span class="bibl">V. Fl. 1.575</span>; Quint. Smyrn. 14.475. Whether he was represented by the ancients in works of art
                     is not certain, but we now possess no representation of him.
