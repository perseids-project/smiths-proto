               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="persName">Ἄρτεμις</span>), one of the great divinities of the Greeks. Her name is usually derived from <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀρτεμής</span>, uninjured, healthy, vigorous; according to which she would be the goddess who is
                  herself inviolate and vigorous, and also grants strength and health to others. (Plat.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Cratyl.</span> p. 406b. ; <span class="bibl">Strab. xiv. p.635</span>; Eustath. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Hom.</span> pp. 32, 577, 1732.) According to the Homeric account and Hesiod (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 918</span>) she was the daughter of Zeus and Leto, whence Aeschylus (<span style="font-style: italic">Sept.</span> 148) calls her <span lang="grc" class="foreign">λητωγένεια</span>. She was the sister of Apollo, and born with him at the same time in the island of
                  Delos. According to a tradition which Pausanias (<span class="bibl">8.37.3</span>) found in Aeschylus, Artemis was a daughter of Demeter, and not of Leto, while according
                  to an Egyptian story (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 2.156</span>) she was the daughter of Dionysus and Isis, and Leto was only her nurse. But these
                  and some other legends are only the results of the identification of the Greek Artemis
                  with other local or foreign divinities. The place of her birth is for the same reason
                  not the same in all traditions : some say that it was the grove of Ortygia near Ephesus
                  (Tacit. <span style="font-style: italic">Annal.</span> 3.61; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind. Nem.</span> 1.1), others that it was Crete (<span class="bibl">Diod. 5.72</span>), and others again, that she was the sister of Apollo, but born somewhat earlier,
                  so that she was able to assist Leto in giving birth to Apollo. (Orph <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 34. 5; Spanheim, <span style="font-style: italic">ad Callim.</span> p. 476, &amp;c.) In the description of the nature and character of this goddess, it is
                  necessary to distinguish between the different points of view from which the Greeks
                  regarded her, and also between the really Greek Artemis and certain foreign divinities,
                  who for some resemblance or another were identified by the Greeks with their own Artemis,
