               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Ἀφροδίτη</span>), one of the great Olympian divinities, was, according to the popular and poetical
                  notions of the Greeks, the goddess of love and beauty. Some traditions stated that
                  she had sprung from the foam (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀφρός</span>) of the sea, which had gathered around the mutilated parts of Uranus, that had been
                  thrown into the sea by Kronos after he had unmanned his father. (Hesiod. <span style="font-style: italic">Theog.</span> 190; compare <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ANADYOMENE.</span>) With the exception of the Homeric hymn on Aphrodite there is no trace of this legend
                  in Homer, and according to him Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and Dione. (<span class="bibl">Il. 5.370</span>, &amp;c., 20.105.) Later traditions call her a daughter of Kronos and Euonyme, or of
                  Uranus and Hemera. (Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">De Nat. Deor.</span> 3.23; Natal. Com. 4.13.) According to Hesiod and the Homeric hymn on Aphrodite, the
                  goddess after rising from the foam first approached the island of Cythera, and thence
                  went to Cyprus, and as she was walking on the sea-coast flowers sprang up under her
                  feet, and Eros and Himeros accompanied her to the assembly of the other great gods,
                  all of whom were struck with admiration and love when she appeared, and her surpassing
                  beauty made every one desire to have her for his wife. According to the cosmogonic
                  views of the nature of Aphrodite, she was the personification of the generative powers
                  of nature, and the mother of all living beings. A trace of this notion seems to be
                  contained in the tradition that in the contest of Typhon with the gods, Aphrodite
                  metamorphosed herself into a fish, which animal was considered to possess the greatest
                  generative powers. (<span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 5.318</span>, &amp;c.; comp. Hygin. <span style="font-style: italic">Poet. Astr.</span> 30.) But according to the popular belief of the Greeks and their poetical descriptions,
                  she was the goddess of love, who excited this passion in the hearts of gods and men,
                  and by this power ruled over all the living creation. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Ven. ;</span> Lucret. 15, &amp;c.) Ancient mythology furnishes numerous instances in which Aphrodite
                  punished those who neglected her worship or despised her power, as well as others
                  in which she favoured and protected those who did homage to her and recognized her
                  sway. Love and beauty are ideas essentially connected, and Aphrodite was therefore
                  also the goddess of beauty and gracefulness. In these poiits she surpassed all other
                  goddesses, and she received the prize of beauty from Paris; she had further the power
                  of granting beauty and invincible charms to others. Youth is the herald, and Peitho,
                  the Horae, and Charites, the attendants and companions of Aphrodite. (Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">New.</span> 8.1, &amp;c.) Marriages are called by Zeus her work and the things about which she ought
                  to busy herself. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 5.429</span>; comp. <span class="bibl">Od. 20.74</span>; <span class="bibl">Pind. P. 9.16</span>, &amp;c.) As she herself had sprung from the sea, she is represented by later writers
                  as having some influence upon the sea (<span class="bibl">Verg. A. 8.800</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Ep. 15.213</span>; comp. <span class="bibl">Paus. 2.34.11</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>During the Trojan war, Aphrodite, the mother of Aeneas, who had been declared the
                  most beautiful of all the goddesses by a Trojan prince, naturally sided with the Trojans.
                  She saved Paris from his contest with Menelaus (<span class="bibl">Il. 3.380</span>), but when she endeavoured to rescue her darling Aeneas from the fight, she was pursued
                  by Diomedes, who wounded her in her hand. In her fright she abandoned her son, and
                  was carried by Iris in the chariot of Ares to Olympus, where she complained of her
                  misfortune to her mother Dione, but was laughed at by Hera and Athena. (<span class="bibl">Il. 5.311</span>, &amp;c.) She also protected the body of Hector, and anointed it with ambrosia. (<span class="bibl">Il. 23.185</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>According to the most common accounts of the ancients, Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus
                  (<span style="font-style: italic">Odyss.</span> 8.270), who, however, is said in the <span class="titlem">Iliad</span> (<span class="bibl">8.383</span>) to have married Charis. Her faithlessness to Hephaestus in her amour with Ares,
                  and the manner in which she was caught by the ingenuity of her husband, are beautifully
                  described in the <span class="titlem">Odyssey</span>. (8.266, &amp;c.) By Ares she became the mother of Phobos, Deimos, Harmonia, and, according
                  to later traditions, of Eros and Anteros also. (Hesiod. <span style="font-style: italic">Theog.</span> 934, &amp;c., <span style="font-style: italic">Scut. Herc.</span> 195; <span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 13.299</span>, <span class="bibl">4.440</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Apollon. Rhod.</span> 3.26; Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">De Nat. Deor.</span> 3.23.) But Ares was not the only god whom Aphrodite favoured; Dionysus, Hermes, and
                  Poseidon likewise enjoyed her charms. By the first she was, according to some traditions,
                  the mother of Priapus (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Apollon. Rhod.</span> 1.933) and Bacchus (Hesych. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Βάκχου Διώνης</span>), by the second of Hermaphroditus (<span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 4.289</span>, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Diod. 4.6</span>; Lucian, <span style="font-style: italic">Dial. Deor.</span> 15.2), and by Poseidon she had two children, Rhodos and Herophilus. (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind. Pyth.</span> 8.24.) As Aphrodite so often kindled in the hearts of the gods a love for mortals,
                  Zeus at last resolved to make her pay for her wanton sport by inspiring her too with
                  love for a mortal man. This was accomplished, and Aphrodite conceived an invincible
                  passion for Anchises, by whom she became the mother of Aeneas and Lyrus. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ANCHISES.</span>] Respecting her connexions with other mortals see <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ADONIS</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">BUTES.</span></p> 
               <p>Aphrodite possessed a magic girdle which had the power of inspiring love and desire
                  for those who wore it; hence it was borrowed by Hera when she wished to stimulate
                  the love of Zeus. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 14.214</span>, &amp;c.) The arrow is also sometimes mentioned as one of her attributes. (Plnd. <span style="font-style: italic">Pyth.</span> 4.380; Theocrit. 11.16.) In the vegetable kingdom the myrtle, rose, apple, poppy,
                  and others, were sacred to her. (<span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 4.15</span>. 143; Bion, <span style="font-style: italic">Idyll.</span> 1.64; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Aristoph. Nub.</span> 993; <span class="bibl">Paus. 2.10.4</span>; Phornut. 23.) The animals sacred to her, which are often mentioned as drawing her
                  <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e220">[Page 229]</span> chariot or serving as her messengers, are the spar row, the dove, the swan, the swallow,
                  and a bird called iynx. (Sappho, <span style="font-style: italic">in Ven.</span> 10; <span class="bibl">Athen. 9.395</span>; <span class="bibl">Hor. Carm. 4.1.10</span>; Aelian, <span class="bibl">Ael. NA 10.34</span>; Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">Py/th/. l.c.</span>) As Aphrodite Urania the tortoise, the symbol of domestic modesty and chastity, and
                  as Aphrodite Pandemos the ram was sacred to her. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">URANIA</span>; <span style="font-variant: small-caps">PANDEMOS.</span>] When she was represented as the victorious goddess, she had the attributes of Ares,
                  a helmet, a shield, a sword : or a lance, and an image of Victory in one hand. The
                  planet Venus and the spring-month of April were likewise sacred to her. (Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor.</span> 3.20; <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 4.90</span>.) All the surnames and epithets given to Aphrodite are derived from places of her
                  worship, from events connected with the legends about her, or have reference to her
                  character and her influence upon man, or are descriptive of her extraordinary beauty
                  and charms. All her surnames are explained in separate articles.
               </p> 
               <p>The principal places of her worship in Greece were the islands of Cyprus and Cythera.
                  At Cnidus in Caria she had three temples, one of which contained her renowned statue
                  by Praxiteles. Mount Ida in Troas was an ancient place of her worship, and among the
                  other places we may mention particularly the island of Cos, the towns of Abydos, Athens,
                  Thespiae, Megara, Sparta, Sicyon, Corinth, and Eryx in Sieily. The sacrifices offered
                  to her consisted mostly of incense and garlands of flowers (<span class="bibl">Verg. A. 1.416</span>; <span class="bibl">Tac. Hist. 2.3</span>), but in some places animals, such as pigs, goats, young cows, hares, and others,
                  were sacrificed to her. In some places, as at Corinth, great numbers of females belonged
                  to her, who prostituted themselves in her service, and bore the name of <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἱερόδουλοι</span>. (<span style="font-style: italic">Dict.of Ant. s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἑταίραι</span>.) Respecting the festivals of Aphrodite see <span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s.v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀδώνια</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀναγώγια</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀφροδίσια</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Καταγώγια</span>.
               </p> 
               <p>The worship of Aphrodite was undoubtedly of eastern origin, and probably introduced
                  from Syria to the islands of Cyprus, Cythera, and others, from whence it spread all
                  over Greece. It is said to have been brought into Syria from Assyria. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.14.6</span>.) Aphrodite appears to have been originally identical with Astarte, called by the
                  Hebrews Ashtoreth, and her connexion with Adonis clearly points to Syria. But with
                  the exception of Corinth, where the worship of Aphrodite had eminently an Asiatic
                  character, the whole worship of this goddess and all the ideas concerning her nature
                  and character are so entirely Greek, that its introduction into Greece must be assigned
                  to the very earliest periods. The elements were derived from the East, but the peculiar
                  development of it belongs to Greece. Respecting the Roman goddess Venus and her identification
                  with the Greek Aphrodite, see <span style="font-variant: small-caps">VENUS.</span></p> 
               <p>Aphrodite, the ideal of female graec and beauty, frequently engaged the talents and
                  genius of the ancient artists. The most celebrated representations of her were those
                  of Cos and Cnidus. Those which are still extant are divided by archaeologists into
                  several classes, accordingly as the goddess is represented in a standing position
                  and naked, as the Medicean Venus, or bathing, or half naked, or dressed in a tunic,
                  or as the victorious goddess in arms, as she was represented in the temples of Cythera,
                  Sparta, and Corinth. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 3.23.1</span>, <span class="bibl">2.5.1</span>, <span class="bibl">3.15.10</span>; comp.
