               <div id="smith-bio">ares-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Ἄρης</span>), the god of war and one of the great Olympian gods of the Greeks. He is represented
                  as the son of Zeus and Hera. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 5.893</span>, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 921</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.3.1</span>.) A later tradition, according to which Hera conceived Ares by touching a certain
                  flower, appears to be an imitation of the legend about the birth of Hephaestus, and
                  is related by Ovid. (<span style="font-style: italic">Fast.</span> 5.255, &amp;c.) The character of Ares in Greek mythology will be best understood if we
                  compare it with that of other divinities who are likewise in some way connected with
                  war. Athena represents thought-fulness and wisdom in the affairs of war, and protects
                  men and their habitations during its ravages. Ares, on the other hand, is nothing
                  but the personification of bold force and strength, and not so much the god of war
                  as of its tumult, confusion, and horrors. His sister Eris calls forth war, Zeus directs
                  its course, but Ares loves war for its own sake, and delights in the din and roar
                  of battles, in the slaughter of men, and the destruction of towns. He is not even
                  influenced by party-spirit, but sometimes assists the one and sometimes the other
                  side, just as his inclination may dictate ; whence Zeus calls him <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀλλοπόσαλλος</span>. (<span class="bibl">Il. 5.889</span>.) The destructive hand of this god was even believed to be active in the ravages
                  made by plagues and epidemics. (Soph. <span style="font-style: italic">Oed. Tyr.</span> 185.) This savage and sanguinary character of Ares makes him hated by the other gods
                  and his own parents. (<span class="bibl">Il. 5.889</span>-<span class="bibl">909</span>.) In the Iliad, he appears surrounded by the personifications of all the fearful
                  phenomena and effects of war (4.440, &amp;c., 15.119, &amp;c.); but in the Odyssey his character
                  is somewhat softened down. It was contrary to the spirit which animated the Greeks
                  to represent a being like Ares, with all his overwhelming physical strength, as always
                  victorious; and when he comes in contact with higher powers, he is usually conquered.
                  He was wounded by Diomedes, who was assisted by Athena, and in his fall he roared
                  like nine or ten thousand other warriors together. (<span class="bibl">Il. 5.855</span>, &amp;c.) When the gods began to take an active part in the war of the mortals, Athena
                  opposed Ares, and threw him on the ground by hurling at him a mighty stone (20.69,
                  21.403, &amp;c.); and when he lay stretched on the earth, his huge body covered the space
                  of seven plethra. The gigantic Aloadae had likewise conquered and chained him, and
                  had kept him a prisoner for thirteen months, until he was delivered by Hermes. (5.385,
                  &amp;c.) In the contest of Typhon against Zeus, Ares was obliged, together with the other
                  gods, to flee to Egypt, where he metamorphosed himself into a fish. (Antonin. Lib.
                  28.) He was also conquered by Heracles, with whom he fought on account of his son
                  Cycnus, and obliged to return to Olympus. (Hesiod, <span style="font-style: italic">Scut. Herc.</span> 461.) In numerous other contests, however, he was victorious. This fierce and gigantic,
                  but withal handsome god loved and was beloved by Aphrodite : he interfered on her
                  behalf with Zeus (5.883), and lent her his war-chariot. (5.363; comp. <span style="font-variant: small-caps">APHRODITE.</span>) When Aphrodite loved Adonis, Ares in his jealonsy metamorphosed himself into a bear,
                  and killed his rival. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ADONIS.</span>] According to a late tradition, Ares slew Halirrhotius, the son of Poseidon, when
                  he was on the point of violating Alcippe, the daughter of Ares. Hereupon Poseidon
                  accused Ares in the Areiopagus, where the Olympian gods were assembled in court. Ares
                  was acquitted, and this event was believed to have given rise to the name Areiopagus.
                  (<span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. v.</span>)
               </p> 
               <p>The warlike character of the tribes of Thrace led to the belief, that the god's residence
                  was in that country, and here and in Scythia were the principal seats of his worship.
                  (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 8.361</span>, with the note of Eustath.; Ov. <span style="font-style: italic">Ars Am.</span> 2.585 ; Statius, <span class="bibl">Stat. Theb. 7.42</span>; <span class="bibl">Hdt. 4.59</span>, <span class="bibl">62</span>.) In Scythia he was worshipped in the form of a sword, to which not only horses and
                  other cattle, but men also were sacrificed. Respecting the worship of an Egyptian
                  divinity called Ares, see Herodotus, <span class="bibl">2.64</span>. He was further worshipped in Colchis, where the golden fleece was suspended on an
                  oak-tree in a grove sacred to him. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.9.16</span>.) From thence the Dioscuri were believed to have brought to Laconia the ancient statue
                  of Ares which was preserved in the temple of Ares Thareitas, on the road from Sparta
                  to Therapnae. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 3.19.7</span>, &amp;c.) The island near the coast of Colchis, in which the Stymphalian birds were believed
                  to have dwelt, and which is called the island of Ares, Aretias, Aria, or Chalceritis,
                  was likewise sacred to him. (Steph. Byz. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἄρεος νῆσος</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 2.1047</span>; <span class="bibl">Plin. Nat. 6.12</span>; Pomp. Mela, 2.7.15.)
               </p> 
               <p>In Greece itself the worship of Ares was not very general. At Athens he had a temple
                  containing a statue made by Alcamenes (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.8.5</span>); at Geronthrae in Laconia he had a temple with a grove, where an annual festival
                  was celebrated, during which no woman was allowed to approach the temple. (3.22.5.)
                  He was also worshipped near Tegea, and in the town (8.44.6, 48.3), at Olympia (5.15.4),
                  near Thebes (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.4.1</span>), and at Sparta, where there was an ancient statue, representing the god in chains,
                  to indicate that the martial spirit and victory were never to leave the city of Sparta.
                  (<span class="bibl">Paus. 3.15.5</span>.) At Sparta human sacrifices were offered to Ares. (Apollod. <span style="font-style: italic">Fragm.</span> p. 1056, ed. Heyne.) The temples of this god were usually built outside the towns,
                  probably to suggest the idea that he was to prevent enemies from approaching them.
               </p> 
               <p>All the stories about Ares and his worship in the countries north of Greece seem to
                  indicate that his worship was introduced in the latter country from Thrace; and the
                  whole character of the god, as described by the most ancient poets of Greece, seems
                  to have been thought little suited to be represented in works of art : in fact, we
                  hear of no artistic representation of Ares previous to the time of Alcamenes, who
                  appears to have created the ideal of Ares. There are few Greek monuments now extant
                  with representations of the god; he appears principally on coins, reliefs, and gems.
                  (Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> i. p. 51.) The Romans identified their god Mars with the Greek Ares. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">MARS.</span>]
