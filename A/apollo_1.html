               </p> 
               <p>1. one of the great divinities of the Greeks, was, according to Homer (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 1.21</span>, <span class="bibl">36</span>), the son of Zeus and Leto. Hesiod( <span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 918</span>) states the same, and adds, that Apollo's sister was Artemis. Neither of the two
                  poets suggests anything in regard to the birth-place of the god, unless we take <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Λυκηγενὴς</span> (<span class="bibl">Il. 4.101</span>) in the sense of "born in Lycia," which, however, according to others, would only
                  mean "born of or in light." Several towns and places claimed the honour of his birth,
                  as we see from various local traditions mentioned by late writers. Thus the Ephesians
                  said that Apollo and Artemis were born in the grove of Ortygia near Ephesus (Tacit.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Annal.</span> 3.61); the inhabitants of Tegyra in Boeotia and of Zoster in Attica claimed the same
                  honour for themselves. (Steph. Byz. <span style="font-style: italic">s.v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Τέγυρα</span>.) In some of these local traditions Apollo is mentioned alone, and in others together
                  with his sister Artemis. The account of Apollo's parentage, too, was not the same
                  in all traditions (Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor.</span> 3.23), and the Egyptians made out that he was a son of Dionysus and Isis. (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 2.156</span>.) But the opinion most universally received was, that Apollo, the son of Zeus and
                  Leto, was born in the island of Delos, together with his sister Artemis; and the circumstances
                  of his birth there are detailed in the Homeric hymn on Apollo, and in that of Callimachus
                  on Delos. (Comp. <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.4.1</span>; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 140</span>.) Hera in her jealousy pursued Leto from land to land and from isle to isle, and
                  endeavoured to prevent her finding a resting-place where to give birth. At last, however,
                  she arrived in Delos, where she was kindly received, and after nine days' labour she
                  gave birth to Apollo under a palm or an olive tree at the foot of mount Cynthus. She
                  was assisted by all the goddesses, except Hera and Eileithyia, but the latter too
                  hastened to lend her aid, as soon as she heard what was taking place. The island of
                  Delos, which previous to this event had been unsteady and floating on or buried under
                  the waves of the sea, now became stationary, and was fastened to the roots of the
                  earth. (Comp. <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 3.75</span>.) The day of Apollo's birth was believed to have been the seventh of the month, whence
                  he is called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἑβδομαγενής</span>. (Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Sympos.</span> 8.) According to some traditions, he was a seven months' child (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἑπταμηναῖος</span>). The number seven was sacred to the god; on the seventh of every month sacrifices
                  were offered to him (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἑβδομαγέτης</span>, Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Sept.</span> 802; comp. Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Del.</span> 250, &amp;c.), and his festivals usually fell on the seventh of a month. Immediately
                  after his birth, Apollo was fed with ambrosia and nectar by Themis, and no sooner
                  had he tasted the divine food, than he sprang up and demanded a lyre and a bow, and
                  declared, that henceforth he would declare to men the will of Zeus. Delos exulted
                  with joy, and covered herself with golden flowers. (Comp. Theognis, 5, &amp;c.; Eurip.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Hecub.</span> 457, &amp;c.)
               </p> 
               <p>Apollo, though one of the great gods of Olympus, is yet represented in some sort of
                  dependence on Zeus, who is regarded as the source of the powers exercised by his son.
                  The powers ascribed to Apollo are apparently of different kinds, but all are connected
                  with one another, and may be said to be only ramifications of one and the same, as
                  will be seen from the following classification.
               </p> 
               <p>Apollo is--</p> 
               <p>1. <span style="font-style: italic">the god who punishes and destroys</span> (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">οὔλιος</span>) <span style="font-style: italic">the wicked and overbearing,</span> and as such he is described as the god with bow and arrows, the gift of Hephaestus.
                  (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 1.42</span>, xxiv. (605, <span class="bibl">Od. 11.318</span>, <span class="bibl">15.410</span>, &amp;c.; comp. <span class="bibl">Pind. P. 3.15</span>, &amp;c.) Various epithets given to him in the Homeric poems, such as <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἕκατος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἑκάεργος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἑκηβόλος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">έκατηβόλος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">κλυτότοξος</span>, and <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀργυρότοξος</span>, refer to him as the god who with his darts hits his object at a distance and never
                  misses it. All sudden deaths of men, whether they were regarded as a punishment or
                  a reward, were believed to be the effect of the arrows of Apollo; and with the same
                  arrows he sent the plague into the camp of the Greeks. Hyginus relates, that four
                  days after his birth, Apollo went to mount Parnassus, and there killed the dragon
                  Python, who had pursued his mother during her wanderings, before she reached Delos.
                  He is also said to have assisted Zeus in his contest with the giants. (Apollod, 1.6.2.)
                  The circumstance of Apollo being the destroyer of the wicked was believed by some
                  of the ancients to have given rise to his name Apollo, which they connected with <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀπόλλυμι</span>, "to destroy." (Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Agam.</span> 1081.) Some modern writers, on the other hand, who consider the power of averting
                  evil to have been the original and principal feature in his character, say that <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀπόλλων</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀπέλλων</span>, (from the root <span style="font-style: italic">pello</span>), signifies the god who drives away evil, and is synonymous with <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀλεξίκακας</span>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ACESIUS</span>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ACESTOR</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">σώτηρ</span>, and other names and epithets applied to Apollo.
               </p> 
               <p>2. <span style="font-style: italic">The god who affords help and wards off evil.</span> As he had the power of visiting men with plagues and epidemics, so he was also able
                  to deliver men from them, if duly propitiated, or at least by his oracles to suggest
                  the means by which such calamities could be averted. Various names and epithets which
                  are given to Apollo, especially by later writers, such as <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀκέσιος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀκέστωρ</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀλεξίκακος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">σώτηρ</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀποτρόπαιος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἐπικούριος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἰατρομάντις</span>, and others, are descriptive of this power. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.3.3</span>, <span class="bibl">6.24.5</span>, <span class="bibl">8.41.5</span>; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Εἰ</span> apud <span style="font-style: italic">Delph.</span> 21, <span style="font-style: italic">de Defect. Orac.</span> 7; Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Eum.</span> 62; comp. Müller, <span style="font-style: italic">Dor.</span> 2.6.3.) It seems to be the idea of his being the god who afforded help, that made
                  him the father of Asclepius, the god of the healing art, and that, at least in later
                  times, identified him with Paceon, the god of the healing art in Homer. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">PAEAN.</span>]
               </p> 
               <p>3. <span style="font-style: italic">The god of prophecy.</span> Apollo exercised this power in his numerous oracles, and especially in that of Delphi.
                  (<span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. v. Oraculum</span>) The source of all his prophetic powers was Zeus himself <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e290">[Page 231]</span> (Apollodorus states, that Apollo received the <span lang="grc" class="foreign">μαντικὴ</span> from Pan), and Apollo is accordingly called "the prophet of his father Zeus." (Aeschyl.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Eum.</span> 19); but he had nevertheless the power of communicating the gift of prophecy both
                  to gods and men, and all the ancient seers and prophets are placed in some relationship
                  to him. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 1.72</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Merc.</span> 3, 471.) The manner in which Apollo came into the possession of the oracle of Delphi
                  (Pytho) is related differently. According to Apollodorus, the oracle had previously
                  been in the possession of Themis, and the dragon Python guarded the mysterious chasm,
                  and Apollo, after having slain the monster, took possession of the oracle. According
                  to Hyginus, Python himself possessed the oracle; while Pausanias (<span class="bibl">10.3.5</span>) states, that it belonged to Gaea and Poseidon in common. (Comp. Eurip. <span style="font-style: italic">Iphig. Taur.</span> 1246, &amp;c.; Atlen. xv. p. 701; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 1.439</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 2.706</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>4. <span style="font-style: italic">The god of song and music.</span> We find him in the Iliad (<span class="bibl">1.603</span>) delighting the immortal gods with his play on the phorminx during their repast ;
                  and the Homeric bards derived their art of song either from Apollo or the Muses. (<span class="bibl">Od. 8.488</span>, with Eustath.) Later traditions ascribed to Apollo even the invention of the flute
                  and lyre (Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Del.</span> 253; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de Mus.),</span> while the more common tradition was, that he received the lyre from Hermes. Ovid
                  <span class="bibl">Ov. Ep. 16.180</span>) makes Apollo build the walls of Troy by playing on the lyre, as Amphion did the
                  walls of Thebes. Respecting his musical contests, see <span style="font-variant: small-caps">MARSYAS</span>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps">MIDAS.</span></p> 
               <p>5. <span style="font-style: italic">The god who protects the flocks and cattle</span> (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">νόμιος Δεὸς</span>, from <span lang="grc" class="foreign">νομὸς</span> or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">νομὴ</span>, a meadow or pasture land). Homer (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 2.766</span>) says, that Apollo reared the swift steeds of Eunlelus Pheretides in Pieria, and
                  according to the Homeric hymn to Hermes (22, 70, &amp;c.) the herds of the gods fed in
                  Pieria under the care of Apollo. At the command of Zeus, Apollo guarded the cattle
                  of Laomedon in the valleys of mount Ida. (<span style="font-style: italic">ll.</span> 21.488.) There are in Homer only a few allusions to this feature in the character
                  of Apollo, but in later writers it assumes a very prominent form (<span class="bibl">Pind. P. 9.114</span>; Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Apoll.</span> 50, &amp;c.); and in the story of Apollo tending the flocks of Admetus at Pherae in Thessaly,
                  on the banks of the river Amphrysus, the idea reaches its height. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.9</span>. &amp;sec; 15; <span class="bibl">Eur. Alc. 8</span>; <span class="bibl">Tib. 2.3. 11</span>; <span class="bibl">Verg. G. 3.2</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>6. <span style="font-style: italic">The god who delights in the foundation of towns and the establishment of civil constilutions.</span> His assistance in the building of Troy was mentioned above; respecting his aid in
                  raising the walls of Megara, see <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ALCATHOUS.</span> Pindar (<span class="bibl">Pind. P. 5.80</span>) calls Apollo the <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀρχηγετης</span>, or the leader of the Dorians in their migration to Peloponnesus; and this idea,
                  as well as the one that he delighted in the foundation of cities. seems to be intimately
                  connected with the circumstance, that a town or a colony was never founded by the
                  Greeks without consulting an oracle of Apollo, so that in every case he became, as
                  it were, their spiritual leader. The epithets <span lang="grc" class="foreign">κτιστὴς</span> and <span lang="grc" class="foreign">οἰκιστὴς</span> (see Böckh, <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind. l.e.</span>) refer to this part in the character of Apollo.
               </p> 
               <p>These characteristics of Apollo necessarily appear in a peculiar light, if we adopt
                  the view which was almost universal among the later poets, mythographers, and philesophers,
                  and according to which Apoilo was identical with Helios, or the Sun. In Homer and
                  for some centuries after his time Apollo and Helios are perfectiy distinet. The question
                  which here presents itself, is, whether the idea of the identity of the two divinities
                  was the original and primitive one, and was only revival in later times, or whether
                  it was the result of later speeulations and of foreign, chiefly Egyptian, influence.
                  Each of these two opinions has had its able advo cates. The former, which has been
                  maintained by Buttmann and Hermann, is supported by strong arguments. In the time
                  of Callimachus, some persons distinguished between Apollo and Helios, for which they
                  were censulred by the poet. (<span style="font-style: italic">Fragm.</span> 48, ed. Bentley.) Pausanias (<span class="bibl">7.23</span>. &amp;sec; 6) states, that he met a Sidonian who declared the two gods to be identical,
                  and Pausanias adds that this was quite in accordance with the belief of the Greeks.
                  (Comp. Strab. xiv. p. (635; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Εἰ</span> ap. <span style="font-style: italic">Delph.</span> 4, de <span style="font-style: italic">Def. Orae.</span> 7.) It has further been said, that if Apollo be regarded as the Sun, the powers and
                  attributes which we have enumerated above are easily explained and accounted for;
                  that the sursname of <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Φοῖβος</span> (the shining or brilliant), which is frequently applied to Apollo in the Homeric
                  poems, points to the sun; and lastly, that the traditions concerning the Hyperboreans
                  and their worship of Apollo bear the strongest marks of their regarding the god in
                  the same light. (Alcaeus, apud <span style="font-style: italic">Himer.</span> 14.10; <span class="bibl">Diod. 2.47</span>.) Still greater stress is laid on the fact that the Egyptian Horus was regarded as
                  identical with Apollo (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 2.144</span>, <span class="bibl">156</span> ; <span class="bibl">Diod. 1.25</span>; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de Is. et Os.</span> 12, 61; Aelian, <span class="bibl">Ael. NA 10.14</span>), as Horus is usually considered as the god of the burning sun. Those who adopt this
                  view derive Apollo from the East or from Egypt, and regard the Athenian <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀπόλλων πατρῷος</span> as the god who was brought to Attica by the Egyptian colony under Cecrops. Another
                  set of accounts derives the worship of Apollo from the very opposite quarter of the
                  world--from the country of the Hyperboreans, that is, a nation living beyond the point
                  where the north wind rises, and whose country is in consequence most happy and fruitful.
                  According to a fragment of an ancient Doric hymn in Pausanias (<span class="bibl">10.5.4</span>), the oracle of Delphi was founded by Hyperboreans and Olenus ; Leto, too, is said
                  to have come from the Hyperboreans to Delos, and Eileithyia likewise. (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 4.33</span>, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Paus. 1.18.4</span>; <span class="bibl">Diod. 2.47</span>.) The Hyperboreans, says Diodorus, worship Apollo more zealously than any other people;
                  they are all priests of Apollo; one town in their country is sacred to Apollo, and
                  its inhabitants are for the most part players on the lyre. (Comp. Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">pyth.</span> 10.55, &amp;c.)

               <p>These opposite accounts respecting the original seat of the worship of Apollo might
                  lead us to suppose, that they refer to two distinct divinities, which were in the
                  course of time united into one, as indeed Cicero (<span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor.</span> 3.23) distinguishes four different Apollos. Müller has rejected most decidedly and
                  justly the hypothesis, that Apollo was derived from Egypt; but he rejects at the same
                  time, without very satisfactory reasons, the opinion that Apollo was connected with
                  the worship of nature or any part of it; for, according to him, Apollo is a purely
                  spiritual divinity, and far above all the other gods of Olympus. As regards the identity
                  of Apollo and Helios, he <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e487">[Page 232]</span> justly remarks, that it would be a strange phenomenon if this identity should have
                  fallen into oblivion for several centuries, and then have been revived. This objection
                  is indeed strong, but not insurmountable if we recollect the tendency of the Greeks
                  to change a peculiar attribute of a god into a separate divinity; and this process,
                  in regard to Helios and Apollo, seems to have taken place previous to the time of
                  Homer. Müller's view of Apollo, which is at least very ingenious, is briefly this.
                  The original and essential feature in the character of Apollo is that of "the averter
                  of evil" (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀπέλλων</span>); he is originally a divinity peculiar to the Doric race; and the most ancient seats
                  of his worship are the Thessalian Tempe and Delphi. From thence it was transplanted
                  to Crete, the inhabitants of which spread it over the coasts of Asia Minor and parts
                  of the continent of Greece, such as Boeotia and Attica. In the latter country it was
                  introduced during the immigration of the Ionians, whence the god became the <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀπόλλων πατρψ͂ος</span> of the Athenians. The conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians raised Apollo to the
                  rank of the principal divinity in the peninsula. The <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀπόλλων νόμιος</span> was originally a local divinity of the shepherds of Arcadia, who was transformed
                  into and identified with the Dorian Apollo during the process in which the latter
                  became the national divinity of the Peloponnesians. In the same manner as in this
                  instance the god assumed the character of a god of herds and flocks, his character
                  was changed and modified in other parts of Greece also : with the Hyperboreans he
                  was the god of prophecy, and with the Cretans the god with bow and darts. In Egypt
                  he was made to form a part of their astronomical system, which was afterwards introduced
                  into Greece, where it became the prevalent opinion of the learned.
               </p> 
               <p>But whatever we may think of this and other modes of explaining the origin and nature
                  of Apollo, one point is certain and attested by thousands of facts, that Apollo and
                  his worship, his festivals and oracles, had more influence upon the Greeks than any
                  other god. It may safily be asserted, that the Greeks would never have become what
                  they were, without the worship of Apollo : in him the brightest side of the Grecian
                  mind is reflected. Respecting his festivals, see <span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀπολλώνια</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Thargelia,</span> and others.
               </p> 
               <p>In the religion of the early Romans there is no trace of the worship of Apollo. The
                  Romans became acquainted with this divinity through the Greeks, and adopted all their
                  notions and ideas about him from the latter people. There is no doubt that the Romans
                  knew of his worship among the Greeks at a very early time, and tradition says that
                  they consulted his oracle at Delphi even before the expulsion of the kings. But the
                  first time that we hear of the worship of Apollo at Rome is in the year <span class="date">B. C. 430</span>, when, for the purpose of averting a plague, a temple was raised to him, and soon
                  after dedicated by the consul, C. Julius. (<span class="bibl">Liv. 4.25</span>, <span class="bibl">29</span>.) A second temple was built to him in the year <span class="date">B. C. 350</span>. One of these two (it is not certain which) stood outside the porta Capena. During
                  the second Punic war, in <span class="date">B. C. 212</span>, the ludi Apollinares were instituted in honour of Apollo. (<span class="bibl">Liv. 25.12</span>; <span class="bibl">Macr. 1.17</span>; <span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. v. Ludi Apollinares; comp. Ludi Sweculares.</span>) The worship of this divinity, however, did not form a very prominent part in the
                  religion of the Romans till the time of Augustus, who, after the battle of Actium,
                  not only dedicated to him a portion of the spoils, but built or embellished his temple
                  at Actium, and founded a new one at Rome on the Palatine, and instituted quinquennial
                  games at Actium. (<span class="bibl">Suet. Aug. 31</span>, <span class="bibl">52</span>; <span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀκτία</span>; Hartung, <span style="font-style: italic">die Religion der Römer,</span> ii. p. 205.)
               </p> 
               <p>Apollo, the national divinity of the Greeks, was of course represented in all the
                  ways which the plastic arts were capable of. As the ideas of the god became gradually
                  and more and more fully developed, so his representations in works of art rose from
                  a rude wooden image to the perfect ideal of youthful manliness, so that he appeared
                  to the ancients in the light of a twin brother of Aphrodite. (<span class="bibl">Plin. Nat. 36.4.10</span>.) The most beautiful and celebrated among the extant representations of Appllo are
                  the Apollo of Belvedere at Rome, which was discovered in 1503 at Rettuno (<span style="font-style: italic">Mus. Pio-Clem.</span> 1.14, 15), and the Apollino at Florence. (Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderbuch,</span> i. p. 29, &amp;c.) In the Apollo of Belvedere, the god is represented with commanding
                  but serene majesty; sublime intellect and physical beauty are combined in it in the
                  most wonderful manner. The forehead is higher than in other ancient figures, and on
                  it there is a pair of locks, while the rest of his hair flows freely down on his neck.
                  The limbs are well proportioned and harmonious, the muscles are not worked out too
                  strongly, and at the hips the figure is rather thin in proportion to the breast. (Buttmann,
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Mythologus,</span> i. p. 1-22; G. Hermann, <span style="font-style: italic">Dissertatio de Apolline et Diana,</span> 2 parts, Leipzig, 1836 and 1837 ; Müller, <span style="font-style: italic">Dorians,</span> book ii.)
