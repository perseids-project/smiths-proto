               <div id="smith-bio">eumenides-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="persName">Εὐμενίδες</span>), also called <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ERINNYES</span>, and by the Romans <span style="font-variant: small-caps">FURIAE</span> or <span style="font-variant: small-caps">DIRAE</span>, were originally nothing but a personification of curses pronounced upon a guilty
                  criminal. The name Erinnys, which is the more ancient one, was derived by the Greeks
                  from the <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἐρίνω ορ ἐρευνάω</span>, I hunt up or persecute, or from the Arcadian word <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἐρινύω</span>, I am angry; so that the Erinnyes were either the angry goddesses, or the goddesses
                  who hunt up or search after the criminal. (Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Eum.</span> 499; <span class="bibl">Pind. O. 2.45</span>; Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">de Nat.</span> Deor. 3.18.) The name Eumenides, which signifies " the well-meaning," or " soothed
                  goddesses," is a mere euphemism, because people dreaded to call these fearful goddesses
                  by their real name, and it was said to have been first given them after the acquittal
                  of Orestes by the court of the Areiopagus, when the anger of the Erinnyes had become
                  soothed. (Soph. <span style="font-style: italic">Oed. Col.</span> 128; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Oed. Col.</span> 42; Suid. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Εὐμενιδες</span>.) It was by a similar euphemism that at Athens the Erinnyes were called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">σεμναἲ Δεαὶ</span>, or the venerable goddesses. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.28</span> § 6) Servius (<span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 4.609</span>) makes a distinction, according to which they bore the name Dirae, when they were
                  conceived as being in heaven by the throne of Zeus, Furiae, when conceived as being
                  on earth, and Eumenides, as beings of the lower world; but this seems to be a purely
                  arbitrary distinction.
               </p> 
               <p>In the sense of <span style="font-style: italic">curse</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">curses,</span> the word Erinnys or Erinnyes is often used in the Homeric poems (<span class="bibl">il. 9.454</span>, <span class="bibl">21.412</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 11.280</span>), and Aeschylus (<span style="font-style: italic">Choeph.</span> 406) calls the Eumenides <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀραί</span> that is, curses. According to the Homeric notion, the Erinnyes, whom the poet conceives
                  as distinct beings, are reckoned among those who inhabit Erebos, srwhere they rest
                  until some curse pronounced upon a criminal calls them to life and activity. (<span style="font-style: italic">Il.</span> ix 571, <span class="bibl">Od. 15.234</span>.) The crimes which they punish are disobedience towards parents, violation of the
                  respect due to old age, perjury, murder, violation of the law of hospitality, and
                  improper conduct towards suppliants. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 9.454</span>, <span class="bibl">15.204</span>, <span class="bibl">19.259</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 2.136</span>, <span class="bibl">17.475</span>.) The notion which is the foundation of the belief in the Eumenides seems to be,
                  that a parent's curse takes from him upon whom it is pronounced all peace of mind,
                  destroys the happiness of his family. and prevents his being blessed with children.
                  (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 4.149</span>; Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Eum.</span> 835.) As the Eumeenides not only punished crimes after death, but during life on
                  earth, they were conceived also as goddesses of fate, who, together with Zeus and
                  the Moerae or Parcae, led such men as were doomed to suffer into misery and misfortunes.
                  (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 19.87</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 15.234</span>.) In the same capacity they also prevented man from obtaining too much knowledge
                  of the future. (<span class="bibl">Il. 19.418</span>.) Homer does not mention any particular names of the Erinnyes, nor does he seem to
                  know of any definite number. Hesiod, who is likewise silent upon these points, calls
                  the Erinyes the daughters of Ge, who conceived them in the drops of blood that fell
                  upon her from the body of Uranus. (<span style="font-style: italic">Theoy.</span> 185; comp. <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.1.4</span>.) Epimenides called them the daughters of Cronos and Euonyme, and sisters of the
                  Moerae (Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph.</span> 406; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Soph. Oed. Col.</span> 42); Aeschylus (<span class="bibl">Aesch. Eum. 321</span>) calls them the daughters of Night; and Sophocles (<span style="font-style: italic">Oed. Col.</span> 40, 106) of Scotos (Darkness) and Ge. (Comp. some other genealogies in Hygin. <span style="font-style: italic">Fab.</span> p. 1; <span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 7.327</span>; Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 69. 2.) The Greek tragedians, with whom, as in the Eumenides of Aeschylus, the number
                  of these goddesses is not limited to a few (Dyer, in the <span style="font-style: italic">Class. Museum,</span> vol. i. pp. 281-298; comp. Eurip. <span style="font-style: italic">Iphig. Taur.</span> 970; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 4.469</span>), no particular name of any one Erinnys is yet mentioned, but they appear in the
                  same capacity, land as the avengers of the same crimes, as before. They are sometimes
                  identified with the Poenae, though their sphere of action is wider than that of the
                  Poenae. From their hunting up and persecuting the cursed criminal, Aeschylus (<span class="bibl">Aesch. Eum. 231</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Choeph.</span> 1055) calls them <span lang="grc" class="foreign">κύνες</span> or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">κυνγέτιδες</span>. No prayer, no sacrifice, and no tears can moove them, or protect the object of their
                  persecution (<span class="bibl">Aesch. Ag. 69</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Eum.</span> 384); and when they fear lest the criminal should escape them, they call in the assistance
                  of Dicé, with whom they are closely connected, the maintenance of strict justice being
                  their only object. (<span class="bibl">Aesch. Eum. 511</span>, <span class="bibl">786</span>; Orph. Argon. 350; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de Eail.</span> 11.) The Erinnyes were more ancient divinities than the Olympian gods, and were therefore
                  not under the rule of Zeus, though they honoured and esteemed him (<span style="font-style: italic">Eum.</span> 918, 1002); and they dwelt in the deep darkness of Tartarus, dreaded by gods and
                  men. Their appearance is described by Aeschylus as Gorgo-like, their bodies covered
                  with black, serpents twined in their hair, and blood dripping from their eyes; Euripides
                  and other later poets describe them as winged beings. (<span style="font-style: italic">Orest.</span> 317, <span style="font-style: italic">Iphig. Taur.</span> 290; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 12.848</span>; Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 68. 5.) The appearance they have in Aeschylus was more or less retained by the poets
                  of later times; but they gradually assumed the character of goddesses who punished
                  crimes after death, and seldom appeared on earth. On the stage, however, and in works
                  of art, their fearful appearrance was greatly softened down, for they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e268">[Page 92]</span> were represented as maidens of a grave and solemn mien, in the richly adorned attire
                  of huntresses, with a band of serpents around their heads, and serpents or torches
                  in their hands. With later writers, though not always, the number of Eumenides is
                  limited to three, and their names are Tisiphone, Alecto, and Megaera. (Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 68; Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph.</span> 406; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 12.845</span>.) At Athens there were statues of only two. (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Oed. Col.</span> 42.) The sacrifices which were offered to them consisted of black sheep and nephalia,
                  <span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span> a drink of honey mixed with water. (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">l.c.;</span> <span class="bibl">Paus. 2.11.4</span>; Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Eum.</span> 107.) Among the things sacred to them we hear of white turtledoves, and the narcissus.
                  (Aelian, <span class="bibl">Ael. NA 10.33</span>; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 87</span>.) They were worshipped at Athens, where they had a sanctuary and a grotto near the
                  Areiopagus : their statues, however, had nothing formidable (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.28.6</span>), and a festival Eumenideia was there celebrated in their honour. Another sanctuary,
                  with a grove which no one was allowed to enter, existed at Colonus. (Soph. <span style="font-style: italic">Oed. Col.</span> 37.) Under the name of <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Μανίαι</span>, they were worshipped at Megalopolis. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.34.1</span>.) They were also worshipped on the Asopus and at Ceryneia. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.11.4</span>, <span class="bibl">7.25.4</span>; comp. Böttiger, <span style="font-style: italic">Furienmaske,</span> Weimar, 1801; Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> p. 201, &amp;c.)
