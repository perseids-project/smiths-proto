<div id="smith-bio">zeus-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Ζεύς</span>), the greatest of the Olympian gods, and the father of gods and men, was a son of
                  Cronos and Rhea, a brother of Poseidon, Hades (Pluto), Hestia, Demeter, Hera, and
                  at the same time married to his sister Hera. When Zeus and his brothers distributed
                  among themselves the government of the world by lot, Poseidon obtained the sea, Hades
                  the lower world, and Zeus the heavens and the upper regions, but the earth became
                  common to all (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 15.187</span>, &amp;c., 1.528, 2.111; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 4.372</span>). Later mythologers enumerate three Zeus in their genealogies two Arcadian ones and
                  one Cretan; and tne first is said to be a son of Aether, the second of Coelus, and
                  the third of Saturnus (Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor.</span> 3.21). This accounts for the fact that some writers use the name of the king of heaven
                  who sends dew, rain, snow, thunder, and lightning for heaven itself in its physical
                  sense. (<span class="bibl">Hor. Carm. 1.1.25</span> ; <span class="bibl">Verg. G. 2.419</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>According to the Homeric account Zeus, like the other Olympian gods, dwelt on Mount
                  Olympus in Thessaly, which was believed to penetrate with its lofty summit into heaven
                  itself (<span class="bibl">Il. 1.221</span>, &amp;c., 354, 609, 21.438). He is called the father of gods and men (1.514, 5.33; comp.
                  Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Sept.</span> 512), the most high and powerful among the immortals, whom all others obey (<span class="bibl">Il. 19.258</span>, <span class="bibl">8.10</span>, &amp;c.). He is the highest ruler, who with his counsel manages every thing (1.175,
                  8.22), the founder of kingly power, of law and of order, whence Dice, Themis and Nemesis
                  are his assistants (1.238, 2.205, 9.99, 16.387; comp. Hes. <span style="font-style: italic">Op. et D. 36 ;</span> Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Jov. 79</span>). For the same reason he protects the assembly of the people (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀγοραῖος</span>, the meetings of the council (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">βουλαῖος</span>), and as he presides over the whole state, so also over every house and family (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἑρκεῖος</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 22.335</span>; comp. Ov. <span style="font-style: italic">Ib. 285</span>). He also watched over the sanctity of the oath (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ὅρκιος</span>), the law of hospitality (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ξένιος</span>), and protected suppliants (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἱκέσιος</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 9.270</span>; comp. <span class="bibl">Paus. 5.24.2</span>). He avenged those who were wronged, and punished those who had committed a crime,
                  for he watched the doings and sufferings of all men (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἐπόψιος</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 13.213</span>; comp. <span class="bibl">Apollon. 1.1123</span>). He was further the original source of all prophetic power, front whom all prophetic
                  signs and sounds proceeded (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">πανομφαῖος</span>, <span class="bibl">Il. 8.250</span> ; comp. Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Eum. 19 ;</span> Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Jov. 69</span>). Every thing good as well as bad comes from Zeus, and according to his own choice
                  he assigns their good or evil lot to mortals (<span class="bibl">Od. 4.237</span>, <span class="bibl">6.188</span>, <span class="bibl">9.552</span>, <span class="bibl">Il. 10.71</span>, <span class="bibl">17.632</span>, &amp;c.), and fate itself was subordinate to him. He is armed with thunder and lightning,
                  and the shaking of his aegis produces storm and tempest (<span class="bibl">Il. 17.593</span>) : a number of epithets of Zeus in the Homeric poems describe him as the thunderer,
                  the gatherer of clouds, and the like. He was married to Hera, by whom he had two sons,
                  Ares and Hephaestus, and one daughter, Hebe (<span class="bibl">Il. 1.585</span>, <span class="bibl">5.896</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 11.604</span>). Hera sometimes acts as an independent divinity, she is ambitious and rebels against
                  her lord, but she is nevertheless inferior to him, and is punished for her opposition
                  (<span class="bibl">Il. 15.17</span>, &amp;c., 19.95, &amp;c.) ; his amours with other goddesses or mortal women are not concealed
                  from her, though they generally rouse her jealousy and revenge (<span class="bibl">Il. 14.317</span>). During the Trojan war, Zeus, at the request of Thetis, favoured the Trojans, until
                  Agamemnon made good the wrong he had done to Achilles. Zeus, no doubt, was originally
                  a god of a portion of nature, whence the oak with its eatable fruit and the fertile
                  doves were sacred to him at Dodona and in Arcadia (hence also rain, storms, and the
                  seasons were regarded as his work, and hence the Cretan stories of milk, honey, and
                  cornucopia) ; but in the Homeric poems, this primitive character of a personification
                  of certain powers of nature is already effaced to some extent, and the god appears
                  as a political and national divinity, as the king and father of men, as the founder
                  and protector of all institutions hallowed by law, custom. or religion.
               </p> 
               <p>Hesiod (<span style="font-style: italic">Theog. 116,</span> &amp;c.) also calls Zeus the son of Cronos and Rhea <span class="notemargin" id="Note1">* As Rhea is sometimes identified with Ge, Zeus is also called a son of Ge. (Aeschyl.
                     <span style="font-style: italic">Suppl. 901.</span>)</span>, and the brother of Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. Crones swallowed
                  his children immediately after their birth, but when Rhea was near giving birth to
                  Zeus, she applied to Uranus and Ge for advice as to how the child might be saved.
                  Before the hour of birth came, Uranus and Ge sent Rhea to Lyetos in Crete, requesting
                  her to bring up her child there. Rhea accordingly concealed her infant in a cave of
                  Mount Aegaeon, and gave to Cronos a stone wrapped up in cloth, which he swallowed
                  in the belief that it was his son. Other traditions state that Zeus was born and brought
                  up on Mount Dicte or Ida (also the Trojan Ida), Ithome in Messenia, Thebes in Boeotia,
                  Aegion in Achaia, or Olenos in Aetolia. According to the common account, however,
                  Zeus grew up in Crete. In the meantime Cronos by a cunning device of Ge or Metis was
                  made to bring up the children he had swallowed, and first of all the stone, which
                  was afterwards set up by Zeus at Delphi. The young god now delivered the Cyclopes
                  from the bonds with which they had been fettered by Cronos, and they in their gratitude
                  provided him with thunder and lightning. On the advice of Ge. Zeus also liberated
                  the hundred-armed Gigantes, Briareos, Cottus, and Gyes, that they might assist him
                  in his fight against the Titans. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.2</span>. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e214">[Page 1323]</span> § 1; Hes. <span style="font-style: italic">Theog. 617,</span> &amp;c.) The Titans were conquered and shut up in Tartarus (<span style="font-style: italic">Theog. 717</span>), where they were henceforth guarded by the Hecatoncheires. Thereupon Tartarus and
                  Ge begot Typhoeus, who began a fearful struggle with Zeus, but was conquered. (<span style="font-style: italic">Theog. 820,</span> &amp;c.) Zeus now obtained the dominion of the world, and chose Metis for his wife. (<span style="font-style: italic">Theog. 881,</span> &amp;c.) When she was pregnant with Athena, he took the child out of her body and concealed
                  it in his own, on the advice of Uranus and Ge, who told him that thereby he would
                  retain the supremacy of the world. For Metis had given birth to a son, this son (so
                  fate had ordained it) would have acquired the sovereignty. After this Zeus, by his
                  second wife Themis. became the father of the Horae and Moerae; of the Charites by
                  Eurynome, of Persephone by Demeter, of the Muses by Mnemosyne, of Apollo and Artemis
                  by Leto, and of Hebe, Ares, and Eileithyia by Hera. Athena was born out of the head
                  of Zeus; while Hera, on the other hand, gave birth to Hephaestus without the co-operation
                  of Zeus. (<span style="font-style: italic">Theog. 8866,</span> &amp;c.) The family of the Cronidae accordingly embraces the twelve great gods of Olympus,
                  Zeus (the head of them all), Poseidon, Apollo, Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Hestia, Demeter,
                  Hera, Athena, Aphrodite, and Artemis. These twelve Olympian gods, who in some places
                  were worshipped as a body, as at Athens (Thueyd. 6.54), were recognised not only by
                  the Greeks, but were adopted also by the Romans, who, in particular, identified their
                  Jupiter with the Greek Zeus.
               </p> 
               <p>In surveying the different local traditions about Zeus, it would seem that originally
                  there were several, at least three, divinities which in their respective countries
                  were supreme, but which in the course of time became united in the minds of the people
                  into one great national divinity. We may accordingly speak of an Arcadian, Dodonaean,
                  Cretan, and a national Hellenic Zeus.
