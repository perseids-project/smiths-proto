               <div id="smith-bio">dionysus-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="persName">Διόνυσος</span> or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Διώνυσος</span>), the youthful, beautiful, but effeminate god of wine. He is also called both by
                  Greeks and Romans Bacchus (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">Βάκχος</span>), that is, the noisy or riotous god, which was originally a mere epithet or surname
                  of Dionysus, but does not occur till after the time of Herodotus. According to the
                  common tradition, Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Semele, the daughter of Cadmus
                  of Thebes (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 6.56; Eurip. <span style="font-style: italic">Bacch.</span> init.; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.4.3</span>); whereas others describe him as a son of Zeus by Demeter, Io, Dione, or Arge. (<span class="bibl">Diod. 3.62</span>, <span class="bibl">74</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind. Pyth.</span> 3.177; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de Flum.</span> 16.) Diodorus (<span class="bibl">3.67</span>) further mentions a tradition, according to which he was a son of Ammon and Amaltheia,
                  and that Ammon, from fear of Rhea, carried the child to a cave in the neighbourhood
                  of mount Nysa, in a lonely island formed by the river Triton. Ammon there entrusted
                  the child to Nysa, the daughter of Aristaeus, and Athena likewise undertook to protect
                  the boy. Others again represent him as a son of Zeus by Persephone or Iris, or describe
                  him simply as a son of Lethe, or of Indus. (<span class="bibl">Diod. 4.4</span>; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Sympos.</span> 7.5; Philostr. <span style="font-style: italic">Vit. Apollon.</span> 2.9.) The same diversity of opinions prevails in regard to the native place of the
                  god, which in the common tradition is Thebes, while in others we find India, Libya,
                  Crete, Dracanum in Samos, Naxos, Elis, Eleutherae, or Teos, mentioned as his birthplace.
                  (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 25.8; <span class="bibl">Diod. 3.65</span>, <span class="bibl">5.75</span>; Nonnus, <span style="font-style: italic">Dionys.</span> 9.6; Theocrit. 26.33.) It is owing to this diversity in the traditions that ancient
                  writers were driven to the supposition that there were originally several divinities
                  which were afterwards identified under the one name of Dionysus. Cicero (<span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor. iii</span> 23) distinguishes five Dionysi, and Diodorus (<span class="bibl">3.63</span>, &amp;c.) three.
               </p> 
               <p>The common story, which makes Dionysus a son of Semele by Zeus, runs as follows: Hera,
                  jealous of Semele, visited her in the disguise of a friend, or an old woman, and persuaded
                  her to request Zeus to appear to her in the same glory and majesty in which he was
                  accustomed to approach his own wife Hera. When all entreaties to desist from this
                  request were fruitless, Zeus at length complied, and appeared to her in thunder and
                  lightning. Semele was terrified and overpowered by the sight, and being seized by
                  the fire, she gave premature birth to a child. Zeus, or according to others, Hermes
                  (<span class="bibl">Apollon. 4.1137</span>) saved the child from the flames: it was sewed up in the thigh of Zeus, and thus
                  came to maturity. Various epithets which are given to the god refer to that occurrence,
                  such as <span lang="grc" class="foreign">πυριγενής, μηρορραφής, μηροτραφής</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">ianigena.</span> (<span class="bibl">Strab. xiii. p.628</span>; <span class="bibl">Diod. 4.5</span>; <span class="bibl">Eur. Ba. 295</span>; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 310</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 4.11</span>.) After the birth of Dionysus, Zeus entrusted him to Hermes, or, according to others,
                  to Persephone or Rhea (Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 45.6; Steph. Byz. s. v. <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Μάσταυρα</span>), who took the child to Ino and Athamas at Orchomenos, and persuaded them to bring
                  him up as a girl. Hera was now urged on by her jealousy to throw Ino and Athamas into
                  a state of madness, and Zeus, in order to save his child, changed him into a ram,
                  and carried him to the nymphs of mount Nysa, who brought him up in a cave, and were
                  afterwards rewarded for it by Zeus, by being placed as Hyades among the stars. (<span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 182</span>; Theon, <span style="font-style: italic">ad Arat. Phaen.</span> 177; comp. <span style="font-variant: small-caps">HYADES.</span>)
               </p> 
               <p>The inhabitants of Brasiae, in Laconia, according to Pausanias (<span class="bibl">3.24.3</span>), told a different story about the birth of Dionysus, When Cadmus heard, they said,
                  that Semele was mother of a son by Zeus, he put her and her child into a chest, and
                  <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e186">[Page 1047]</span> threw it into the sea. The chest was carried by the wind and waves to the coast of
                  Brasiae. Semele was found dead, and was solemnly buried, but Dionysus was brought
                  up by Ino, who happened at the time to be at Brasiae. The plain of Brasiae was, for
                  this reason, afterwards called the garden of Dionysus.
               </p> 
               <p>The traditions about the education of Dionysus, as well as about the personages who
                  undertook it, differ as much as those about his parentage and birthplace. Besides
                  the nymphs of mount Nysa in Thrace, the muses, Lydae, Bassarae, Macetae, Mimallones
                  (Eustath. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Hom.</span> pp. 982, 1816), the nymph Nysa (<span class="bibl">Diod. 3.69</span>), and the nymphs Philia, Coronis, and Cleis, in Naxos, whither the child Dionysus
                  was said to have been carried by Zeus (<span class="bibl">Diod. 4.52</span>), are named as the beings to whom the care of his infancy was entrusted. Mystis,
                  moreover, is said to have instructed him in the mysteries (Nonn. <span style="font-style: italic">Dionys.</span> 13.140), and Hippa, on mount Tmolus, nursed him (Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 47.4); Macris, the daughter of Aristaeus, received him from the hands of Hermes,
                  and fed him with honey. (<span class="bibl">Apollon. 4.1131</span>.) On mount Nysa, Bromie and Bacche too are called his nurses. (Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Eclog.</span> 6.15.) Mount Nysa, from which the god was believed to have derived his name, was
                  not only in Thrace and Libya, but mountains of the same name are found in different
                  parts of the ancient world where he was worshipped, and where he was believed to have
                  introduced the cultivation of the vine. Hermes, however, is mixed up with most of
                  the stories about the infancy of Dionysus, and he was often represented in works of
                  art, in connexion with the infant god. (Comp. <span class="bibl">Paus. 3.18.7</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>When Dionysus had grown up, Hera threw him also into a state of madness, in which
                  he wandered about through many countries of the earth. A tradition in Hyginus (<span style="font-style: italic">Poet. Astr.</span> 2.23) makes him go first to the oracle of Dodona, but on his way thither he came
                  to a lake, which prevented his proceeding any further. One of two asses he met there
                  carried him across the water, and the grateful god placed both animals among the stars,
                  and asses henceforth remained sacred to Dionysus. According to the common tradition,
                  Dionysus first wandered through Egypt, where he was hospitably received by king Proteus.
                  He thence proceeded through Syria, where he flayed Damascus alive, for opposing the
                  introduction of the vine, which Dionysus was believed to have discovered (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">εύρετὴς ἀμπέλου</span>). He now traversed all Asia. (<span class="bibl">Strab. xv. p.687</span>; <span class="bibl">Eur. Ba. 13</span>.) When he arrived at the Euphrates, he built a bridge to cross the river, but a tiger
                  sent to him by Zeus carried him across the river Tigris. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 10.29</span>; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de Flum.</span> 24.) The most famous part of his wanderings in Asia is his expedition to India, which
                  is said to have lasted three, or, according to some, even 52 years. (<span class="bibl">Diod. 3.63</span>, <span class="bibl">4.3</span>.) He did not in those distant regions meet with a kindly reception everywhere, for
                  Myrrhanus and Deriades, with his three chiefs Blemys, Orontes, and Oruandes, fought
                  against him. (Steph. Byz. <span style="font-style: italic">s. vv.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Βλέμυες</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Γάζος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Γήρεια</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Δάρδαι</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἔαρες</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ζάβιοι</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Μάλλοι</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Πάνδαι</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Σίβαι</span>.) But Dionysus and the host of Pans, Satyrs, and Bacchic women, by whom he was accompanied,
                  conquered his enemies, taught the Indians the cultivation of the vine and of various
                  fruits, and the worship of the gods; he also founded towns among them, gave them laws,
                  and left behind him pillars and monuments in the happy land which he had thus conquered
                  and civilized, and the inhabitants worshipped him as a god. (Comp. <span class="bibl">Strab. xi. p.505</span>; Arrian, <span class="bibl">Ind. 5</span>; <span class="bibl">Diod. 2.38</span>; Philostr. <span style="font-style: italic">Vit. Apollon.</span> 2.9; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 6.805</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>Dionysus also visited Phrygia and the goddess Cybele or Rhea, who purified him and
                  taught him the mysteries, which according to Apollodorus (<span class="bibl">3.5.1</span>.) took place before he went to India. With the assistance of his companions, he drove
                  the Amazons from Ephesus to Samos, and there killed a great number of them on a spot
                  which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema. (Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Quaest. Gr.</span> 56.) According to another legend, he united with the Amazons to fight against Cronus
                  and the Titans, who had expelled Ammon from his dominions. (<span class="bibl">Diod. 3.70</span>, &amp;c.) He is even said to have gone to Iberia, which, on leaving, he entrusted to
                  the government of Pan. (Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de Flum.</span> 16.) On his passage through Thrace he was ill received by Lycurgus, king of the Edones,
                  and leaped into the sea to seek refuge with Thetis, whom he afterwards rewarded for
                  her kind reception with a golden urn, a present of Hephaestus. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 6.135</span>, &amp;c., <span class="bibl">Od. 24.74</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Hom. Il.</span> 13.91. Comp. <span class="bibl">Diod. 3.65</span>.) All the host of Bacchantic women and Satyrs, who had accompanied him, were taken
                  prisoners by Lycurgus, but the women were soon set free again. The country of the
                  Edones thereupon ceased to bear fruit, and Lycurgus became mad and killed his own
                  son, whom he mistook for a vine, or, according to others (<span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 3.14</span>) he cut off his own legs in the belief that he was cutting down some vines. When
                  this was done, his madness ceased, but the country still remained barren, and Dionysus
                  declared that it would remain so till Lycurgus died. The Edones, in despair, took
                  their king and put him in chains, and Dionysus had him torn to pieces by horses. After
                  then proceeding through Thrace without meeting with any further resistance, he returned
                  to Thebes, where he compelled the women to quit their houses, and to celebrate Bacchic
                  festivals on mount Cithaeron, or Parnassus. Pentheus, who then ruled at Thebes, endeavoured
                  to check the riotous proceedings, and went out to the mountains to seek the Bacchic
                  women; but his own mother, Agave, in her Bacchic fury, mistook him for an animal,
                  and tore him to pieces. (Theocrit. <span style="font-style: italic">Id.</span> xxvi.; <span class="bibl">Eur. Ba. 1142</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 3.714</span>, &amp;c.)
               </p> 
               <p>After Dionysus had thus proved to the Thebans that he was a god, he went to Argos.
                  As the people there also refused to acknowledge him, he made the women mad to such
                  a degree, that they killed their own babes and devoured their flesh. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.5.2</span>.) According to another statement, Dionysus with a host of women came from the islands
                  of the Aegean to Argos, but was conquered by Perseus, who slew many of the women.
                  (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.20.3</span>, <span class="bibl">22.1</span>.) Afterwards, however, Dionysus and Perseus became reconciled, and the Argives adopted
                  the worship of the god, and built temples to him. One of these was called the temple
                  of Dionysus Cresius, because the god was believed to have buried on that spot Ariadne,
                  his beloved, who was a Cretan. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.23.7</span>.) The last feat of Dionysus was performed on a voyage from Icaria to Naxos. He hired
                  a ship which belonged to Tyrrhenian pirates; but the men, instead of landing at Naxos,
                  passed by and steered towards Asia to sell him there. The god, however, on perceiving
                  this, changed the mast and oars <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e348">[Page 1048]</span> into serpents, and himself into a lion; he filled the vessel with ivy and the sound
                  of flutes, so that the sailors, who were seized with madness, leaped into the sea,
                  where they were metamorphosed into dolphins. (
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Apollod. 3.5.3</div>
               <p>; Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 6.44; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 3.582</span>, &amp;c.) In all his wanderings and travels the god had rewarded those who had received
                  him kindly and adopted his worship : he gave them vines and wine.
               </p> 
               <p>After he had thus gradually established his divine nature throughout the world, he
                  led his mother out of Hades, called her Thyone, and rose with her into Olympus. (Apollod.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span>) The place, where he had come forth with Semele from Hades, was shewn by the Troezenians
                  in the temple of Artemis Soteira (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.31.2</span>); the Argives, on the other hand, said, that he had emerged with his mother from
                  the Alcyonian lake. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.37.5</span>; Clem. Alex. <span style="font-style: italic">Adm. ad Gr.</span> p. 22.) There is also a mystical story, that the body of Dionysus was cut up and
                  thrown into a cauldron by the Titans, and that he was restored and cured by Rhea or
                  Demeter. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.37.3</span>; <span class="bibl">Diod. 3.62</span>; Phurnut. <span style="font-style: italic">N. D.</span> 28.)
               </p> 
               <p>Various mythological beings are described as the offspring of Dionysus; but among
                  the women, both mortal and immortal, who won his love, none is more famous in ancient
                  history than Ariadne. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ARIADNE.</span>] The extraordinary mixture of traditions which we have here had occasion to notice,
                  and which might still be considerably increased, seems evidently to be made up out
                  of the traditions of different times and countries, referring to analogous divinities,
                  and transferred to the Greek Dionysus. We may, however, remark at once, that all traditions
                  which have reference to a mystic worship of Dionysus, are of a comparatively late
                  origin, that is, they belong to the period subsequent to that in which the Homeric
                  poems were composed; for in those poems Dionysus does not appear as one of the great
                  divinities, and the story of his birth by Zeus and the Bacchic orgies are not alluded
                  to in any way : Dionysus is there simply described as the god who teaches man the
                  preparation of wine, whence he is called the " drunken god " (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">μαινόμενος</span>), and the sober king Lycurgus will not, for this reason, tolerate him in his kingdom.
                  (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 6.132</span>, &amp;c., <span class="bibl">Od. 18.406</span>, comp. 11.325.) As the cultivation of the vine spread in Greece, the worship of Dionysus
                  likewise spread further; the mystic worship was developed by the Orphici, though it
                  probably originated in the transfer of Phrygian and Lydian modes of worship to that
                  of Dionysus. After the time of <a class="link_ref" href="alexander-the-great-bio-1">Alexander's</a> expedition to India, the celebration of the Bacchic festivals assumed more and more
                  their wild and dissolute character.
               </p> 
               <p>As far as the nature and origin of the god Dionysus is concerned, he appears in all
                  traditions as the representative of some power of nature, whereas Apollo is mainly
                  an ethical deity. Dionysus is the productive, overflowing and intoxicating power of
                  nature, which carries man away from his usual quiet and sober mode of living. Wine
                  is the most natural and appropriate symbol of that power, and it is therefore called
                  "the fruit of Dionysus." (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">Διονύσου καρπός</span>; Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">Fragm.</span> 89, ed. Böckh.) Dionysus is, therefore, the god of wine, the inventor and teacher
                  of its cultivation, the giver of joy, and the disperser of grief and sorrow. (Bacchyl.
                  apud <span style="font-style: italic">Athen.</span> ii. p. 40; Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">Fragm.</span> 5; <span class="bibl">Eur. Ba. 772</span>.) As the god of wine, he is also both an inspired and an inspiring god, that is,
                  a god who has the power of revealing the future to man by oracles. Thus, it is said,
                  that he had as great a share in the Delphic oracle as Apollo (<span class="bibl">Eur. Ba. 300</span>), and he himself had an oracle in Thrace. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 9.30.5</span>.) Now, as prophetic power is always combined with the healing art, Dionysus is, like
                  Apollo, called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἰατπός</span>, or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ϝ̔γιατής</span> (<span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1624</span>), and at his oracle of Amphicleia, in Phocis, he cured diseases by revealing the
                  remedies to the sufferers in their dreams. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 10.33.5</span>.) Hence he is invoked as a <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Δεὸς σωτήρ</span> against raging diseases. (Soph. <span style="font-style: italic">Oed. Tyr.</span> 210; Lycoph. 206.) The notion of his being the cultivator and protector of the vine
                  was easily extended to that of his being the protector of trees in general, which
                  is alluded to in various epithets and surnames given him by the poets of antiquity
                  (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.31.2</span>, <span class="bibl">7.21.2</span>), and he thus comes into close connexion with Demeter. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 7.20.1</span>; Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">Isthm.</span> 7.3; Theocrit. 20.33; <span class="bibl">Diod. 3.64</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 3.736</span>; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Quaest. Gr.</span> 36.) This character is still further developed in the notion of his being the promoter
                  of civilization, a law-giver, and a lover of peace. (<span class="bibl">Eur. Ba. 420</span>; <span class="bibl">Strab. x. p.468</span>; <span class="bibl">Diod. 4.4</span>.) As the Greek drama had grown out of the dithyrambic choruses at the festivals of
                  Dionysus, he was also regarded as the god of tragic art, and as the protector of theatres.
                  In later times, he was worshipped also as a <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Δεὸς χΔόνιος</span>, which may have arisen from his resemblance to Demeter, or have been the result of
                  an amalgamation of Phrygian and Lydian forms of worship with those of the ancient
                  Greeks. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.37.3</span>; Arnob. <span style="font-style: italic">ad v. Gent.</span> 5.19.) The orgiastic worship of Dionysus seems to have been first established in
                  Thrace, and to have thence spread southward to mounts Helicon and Parnassus, to Thebes,
                  Naxos, and throughout Greece, Sicily, and Italy, though some writers derived it from
                  Egypt. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.2.4</span>; <span class="bibl">Diod. 1.97</span>.) Respecting his festivals and the mode of their celebration, and especially the
                  introduction and suppression of his worship at Rome, see <span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. vv.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀγριώνια</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀνθεστήρια</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἁλῶα</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Αἰώρα</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic">Dionysia.</span></p> 
               <p>In the earliest times the Graces, or Charites, were the companions of Dionysus (<span class="bibl">Pind. O. 13.20</span>; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Quaest. Gr.</span> 36; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 4.424</span>), and at Olympia he and the Charites had an altar in common. (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind. Ol.</span> 5.10 ; <span class="bibl">Paus. 5.14</span> in fin.) This circumstance is of great interest, and points out the great change
                  which took place in the course of time in the mode of his worship, for afterwards
                  we find him accompanied in his expeditions and travels by Bacchantic women. called
                  Lenae, Maenades, Thyiades, Mimallones, Clodones, Bassarae or Bassarides, all of whom
                  are represented in works of art as raging with madness or enthusiasm, in vehement
                  motions, their heads thrown backwards, with dishevelled hair, and carrying in their
                  hands thyrsus-staffs (entwined with ivy, and headed with pine-cones), cymbals, swords,
                  or serpents. Sileni, Pans, satyrs, centaurs, and other beings of a like kind, are
                  also the constant companions of the god. (<span class="bibl">Strab. x. p.468</span>; <span class="bibl">Diod. 4.4</span>. &amp;c.; Catull. 64. 258 ; Athen. i. p. 33; <span class="bibl">Paus. 1.2.7</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>The temples and statues of Dionysus were very numerous in the ancient world. Among
                  the sacrifices <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e545">[Page 1049]</span> which were offered to him in the earliest times, human sacrifices are also mentioned.
                  (
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Paus. 7.21.1</div>
               <p>; Porphyr. <span style="font-style: italic">de Abstin.</span> 2.55.) Subsequently, however, this barbarous custom was softened down into a symbolic
                  scourging, or animals were substituted for men, as at Potniae. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.23.1</span>, <span class="bibl">9.8.1</span>.) The animal most commonly sacrificed to Dionysus was a ram. (<span class="bibl">Verg. G. 2.380</span>, <span class="bibl">395</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 1.357</span>.) Among the things sacred to him, we may notice the vine, ivy, laurel, and asphodel;
                  the dolphin, serpent, tiger, lynx, panther, and ass; but he hated the sight of an
                  owl. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.39.4</span>; Theocrit. 26.4; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Sympos.</span> 3.5; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 87</span>; <span class="bibl">Verg. Ecl. 5.30</span>; Hygin. <span style="font-style: italic">Poet. Astr.</span> 2.23; Philostr. <span style="font-style: italic">Imay.</span> 2.17; <span style="font-style: italic">Vit. Apollon.</span> 3.40.) The earliest images of the god were mere Hermae with the phallus (<span class="bibl">Paus. 9.12.3</span>), or his head only was represented. (<span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1964</span>.) In later works of art he appears in four different forms: 1. As an infant handed
                  over by Hermes to his nurses, or fondled and played with by satyrs and Bacchae. 2.
                  As a manly god with a beard, commonly called the Indian Bacchus. He there appears
                  in the character of a wise and dignified oriental monarch; his features are expressive
                  of sublime tranquillity and mildness; his beard is long and soft, and his Lydian robes
                  (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">βασσάρα</span>) are long and richly folded. His hair sometimes floats down in locks, and is sometimes
                  neatly wound around the head, and a diadem often adorns his forehead. 3. The youthful
                  or so-called Theban Bacchus, was carried to ideal beauty by Praxiteles. The form of
                  his body is manly and with strong outlines, but still approaches to the female form
                  by its softness and roundness. The expression of the countenance is languid, and shews
                  a kind of dreamy longing; the head, with a diadem, or a wreath of vine or ivy, leans
                  somewhat on one side; his attitude is never sublime, but easy, like that of a man
                  who is absorbed in sweet thoughts, or slightly intoxicated. He is often seen leaning
                  on his companions, or riding on a panther, ass, tiger, or lion. The finest statue
                  of this kind is in the villa Ludovisi 4. Bacchus with horns, either those of a ram
                  or of a bull. This representation occurs chiefly on coins, but never in statues. (Welcker,
