               <div id="smith-bio">demeter-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Δημήτηρ</span>), one of the great divinities of the Greeks. Tho name Demeter is supposed by some
                  to be the same as <span lang="grc" class="foreign">γῆ μήτηρ</span>, that is, mother earth, while others consider Deo, which is synonymous with Demeter,
                  as connected with <span lang="grc" class="foreign">δάις</span> and <span lang="grc" class="foreign">δαίνυμι</span>, and as derived from the Cretan word dha/i, barley, so that Demeter would be the
                  mother or giver of barley or of food generally. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 5.500</span>.) These two etymologies, however do not suggest any difference in the character <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e86">[Page 960]</span> of the goddess, but leave it essentially the same. Demeter was the daughter of Cronus
                  and Rhea, and sister of Hestia, Hera, Aides, Poseidon, and Zeus. Like the other children
                  of Cronus she was devoured by her father, but he gave her forth again after taking
                  the emetic which Metis had given him. (Hesiod. <span style="font-style: italic">Theog.</span> 452, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.2.1</span>.) By her brother Zeus, Demeter became the mother of Persephone (Proserpina) and Dionysus
                  (Hesiod. <span style="font-style: italic">Theoq.</span> 912; <span class="bibl">Diod. 3.62</span>), and by Poseidon of Despoena and the horse Arion. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.6.8</span>; <span class="bibl">Paus. 8.37.6</span>.) The most prominent part in the mythus of Demeter is the rape of her daughter Persephone
                  by Pluto, and this story not only suggests the main idea embodied in Demeter, but
                  also directs our attention to the principal seats of her worship. Zeus, without the
                  knowledge of Demeter, had promised Persephone to Pluto, and while the unsuspecting
                  maiden was gathering flowers which Zeus had caused to grow in order to tempt her and
                  to favour Pluto's scheme, the earth suddenly opened and she was carried off by Aidoneus
                  (Pluto). Her cries of anguish were heard only by Hecate and Helios. Her mother, who
                  heard only the echo of her voice, immediately set out in search of her daughter. The
                  spot where Persephone was believed to have been carried into the lower world is different
                  in the different traditions; the common story places it in Sicily, in the neighbourhood
                  of Enna, on mount Aetna, or between the wells Cyane and Arethusa. (<span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 146</span>, <span class="bibl">274</span>; Ov. <span style="font-style: italic">Met. v.</span> 385, <span style="font-style: italic">Fast.</span> 4.422; <span class="bibl">Diod. 5.3</span>; Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">in Verr.</span> 4.48.) This legend, which points to Sicily, though undoubtedly very ancient (<span class="bibl">Pind. N. 1.17</span>), is certainly not the original tradition, since the worship of Demeter was introduced
                  into Sicily by colonists from Megara and Corinth. Other traditions place the rape
                  of Persephone at Erineus on the Cephissus, in the neighbourhood of Eleusis (Orph.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 17.15), at Colonus in Attica (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Soph. Oed. Col.</span> 1590), in an island of the Atlantic near the western coast of Spain (Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Argon.</span> 1190), at Hermione in Peloponnesus (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.5.1</span>; <span class="bibl">Strab. viii. p.373</span>), in Crete (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Hesiod. Theog.</span> 914), or in the neighbourhood of Pisa. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 6.21.1</span>.) Others again place the event at Pheneus in Arcadia (Conon, <span style="font-style: italic">Narr.</span> 15), or at Cyzicus (Propert. 3.21. 4), while the Homeric hymn on Demeter places it
                  in the plain of Nysa in Asia. In the Iliad and Odyssey the rape of Persephone is not
                  expressly mentioned. Demeter wandered about in search of her daughter for nine days,
                  without taking any nectar or ambrosia, and without bathing. On the tenth she met Hecate,
                  who told her that she had heard the cries of Persephone, but did not know who had
                  carried her off. Both then hastened to Helios, who revealed to them thai Pluto had
                  been the ravisher, and with the consent of Zeus. Demeter in her anger at this news
                  avoided Olympus, and dwelt upon earth among men, conferring presents and blessings
                  wherever she was kindly received, and severely punishing those who repulsed her or
                  did not receive her gifts with proper reverence. In this manner she came to Celeus
                  at Eleusis. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">CELEUS.</span>] As the goddess still continued in her anger, and produced famine on the earth by
                  not allowing the fields to produce any fruit, Zeus, anxious that the race of mortals
                  should not become extinct, sent Iris to induce Demeter to return to Olympus. (Comp.
                  <span class="bibl">Paus. 8.42.2</span>.) But in vain. At length Zeus sent out all the gods of Olympus to conciliate her
                  by entreaties and presents; but she vowed not to return to Olympus, nor to restore
                  the fertility of the earth, till she had seen her daughter again. Zeus accordingly
                  sent Hermes into Erebus to fetch back Persephone. Aidoneus consented, indeed, to Persephone
                  returning, but gave her a part of a pomegranate to eat, in order that she might not
                  always remain with Demeter. Hermes then took her in Pluto's chariot to Eleusis to
                  her mother, to whom, after a hearty welcome, she related her fate. At Eleusis both
                  were joined by Hecate, who henceforth remained the attendant and companion of Persephone.
                  Zeus now sent Rhea to persuade Demeter to return to Olympus, and also granted that
                  Persephone should spend only a part of the year (<span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span> the winter) in subterraneous darkness, and that during the rest of the year she should
                  remain with her mother. (Comp. <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 5.565</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Fast.</span> 4.614; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 146</span>.) Rhea accordingly descended to the Rharian plain near Eleusis, and conciliated Demeter,
                  who now again allowed the fruits of the fields to grow. But before she parted from
                  Eleusis, she instructed Triptolemus, Diocles, Eumolpus, and Celeus in the mode of
                  her worship and in the mysteries.
               </p> 
               <p>These are the main features of the mythus about Demeter, as it is contained in the
                  Homeric hymn; in later traditions it is variously modified. Respecting her connexions
                  with Jasion or Jasius, Tantalus, Melissa, Cychreus, Erysichthon, Pandareus, and others,
                  see the different articles. Demeter was the goddess of the earth (<span class="bibl">Eur. Ba. 276</span>), and more especially of the earth as producing fruit, and consequently of agriculture,
                  whence human food or bread is called by Homer <span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 13.322</span>) the gift of Demeter. The notion of her being the author of the earth's fertility
                  was extended to that of fertility in general, and she accordingly was looked upon
                  also as the goddess of marriage (<span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 4.58</span>), and was worshipped especially by women. Her priestess also initiated young married
                  people into the duties of their new situation. (Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de Off. conj.</span> 1.) As the goddess of the earth she was like the other <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Δεόι χθόνιοι</span>, a subterraneous divinity, who worked in the regions inaccessible to the rays of
                  Helios. As agriculture is the basis of a well-regulated social condition, Demeter
                  is represented also as the friend of peace and as a law-giving goddess. (*De/omof/oros,
                  Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Cer.</span> 138; Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 39. 4; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 4.58</span>; <span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 5.500</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 5.341</span>; <span class="bibl">Paus. 8.15.1</span>.) The mythus of Demeter and her daughter embodies the idea, that the productive powers
                  of the earth or nature rest or are concealed during the winter season; the goddess
                  (Demeter and Persephone, also called Cora, are here identified) then rules in the
                  depth of the earth mournful, but striving upwards to the allanimating light. Persephone,
                  who has eaten of the pomegranate, is the fructified flower that returns in spring,
                  dwells in the region of light during a portion of the year, and nourishes men and
                  animals with her fruits. Later philosophical writers, and perhaps the mysteries also,
                  referred the disappearance and return of Persephone to the burial of the body of man
                  and the immortality of his soul. Demeter was worshipped in Crete, Delos, Argolis,
                  Attica, th western coast of Asia, Sicily <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e214">[Page 961]</span> and Italy, and her worship consisted in a great measure in orgic mysteries. Among
                  the many festivals celebrated in her honour, the Thesmophoria and Eleusinia were the
                  principal ones. (<span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. vv. Chloea, Haloa, Thesmophoria, Eleusinia, Megalartia Chthonia.</span>) The sacrifices offered to her consisted of pigs, the symbol of fertility, bulls,
                  cows, honey-cakes, and fruits. (<span class="bibl">Macr. 1.12</span>, <span class="bibl">3.11</span>; <span class="bibl">Diod. 5.4</span>; <span class="bibl">Paus. 2.35.4</span>, <span class="bibl">8.42</span>, in fin.; <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 4.545</span>.) Her temples were called Megara, and were often built in groves in the neighbourhood
                  of towns. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.39.4</span>, <span class="bibl">40.5</span>, <span class="bibl">7.26.4</span>, <span class="bibl">8.54.5</span>, <span class="bibl">9.25.5</span>; <span class="bibl">Strab. viii. p.344</span>, ix. p. 435.) Many of her surnames, which are treated of in separate articles, are
                  descriptive of the character of the goddess. She was often represented in works of
                  art, though scarcely one entire statue of her is preserved. Her representations appear
                  to have been brought to ideal perfection by Praxiteles. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.2.4</span>.) Her image resembled that of Hera, in its maternal character, but had a softer expression,
                  and her eyes were less widely opened. She was represented sometimes in a sitting attitude,
                  sometimes walking, and sometimes riding in a chariot drawn by horses or dragons, but
                  always in full attire. Around her head she wore a garland of corn-ears or a simple
                  ribband, and in her hand she held a sceptre, cornears or a poppy, sometimes also a
                  torch and the mystic basket. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 3.19.4</span>, <span class="bibl">8.31.1</span>, <span class="bibl">42.4</span>; <span class="bibl">Plin. Nat. 34.8. s. 19</span>.) She appears most frequently on gems and vases.
               </p> 
               <p>The Romans received the worship of Demeter, to whom they applied the name of Ceres,
                  from Sicily. (<span class="bibl">V. Max. 1.1.1</span>.) The first temple of Ceres at Rome was vowed by the dictator A. Postumius Albinus,
                  in <span class="date">B. C. 496</span>, for the purpose of averting a famine with which Rome was threatened during a war
                  with the Latins. (<span class="bibl">Dionys. A. R. 6.17</span>, comp. 1.33; <span class="bibl">Tac. Ann. 2.49</span>.) In introducing this foreign divinity, the Romans acted in their usual manner; they
                  instituted a festival with games in honour of her (<span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of A t. s. v. Cerealia</span>), and gave the management of the sacred rites and ceremonies to a Greek priestess,
                  who was usually taken from Naples or Velia, and received the Roman franchise, in order
                  that the sacrifices on behalf of the Roman people might be offered up by a Roman citizen.
                  (Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">pro Balb.</span> 24; Festus, <span style="font-style: italic">s. v. Graeca sacra.</span>) In all other respects Ceres was looked upon very much in the same light as Tellus,
                  whose nature closely resembled that of Ceres. Pigs were sacrificed to both divinities,
                  in the seasons of sowing and in harvest time, and also It the burial of the dead.
                  It is strange to find that the Romans, in adopting the worship of Demeter from the
                  Greeks, did not at the same time adopt the Greek name Demeter. The name Ceres can
                  scarcely be explained from the Latin language. Servius informs us (<span style="font-style: italic">ad Aen.</span> 2.325), that Ceres, Pales, and Fortuna were the penates of the Etruscans, and it
                  may be that the Romans applied to Demeter the name of a divinity of a similar nature,
                  whose worship subsequently became extinct, and left no trace except the name Ceres.
                  We remarked above that Demeter and Persephone or Cora were identified in the mythus,
                  and it may be that Ceres is only a different form for Cora or Core. But however this
                  may be, the worship of Ceres soon acquired considerable political importance at Rome.
                  The property of traitors against the republic was often made over to her temple. (<span class="bibl">Dionys. A. R. 6.89</span>, <span class="bibl">8.79</span>; <span class="bibl">Plin. Nat. 34.4. s. 9</span>; <span class="bibl">Liv. 2.41</span>.) The decrees of the senate were deposited in her temple for the inspection of the
                  tribunes of the people. (<span class="bibl">Liv. 3.55</span>, <span class="bibl">33.25</span>.) If we further consider that the aediles had the special superintendence of this
                  temple, it is very probable that Ceres, whose worship was like the plebeians, introduced
                  at Rome from without, had some peculiar relation to the plebeian order.
