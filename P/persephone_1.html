<div id="smith-bio">persephone-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Περσεφόνη</span>), in Latin <span style="font-style: italic">Proserpina,</span> the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 14.326</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 11.216</span>; Hes. <span style="font-style: italic">Theog</span>. 912, &amp;c. ; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.5.1</span>.) Her name is commonly derived from <span lang="grc" class="foreign">φερειν φόνον</span>, "to bring" or "cause death," and the form Persephone occurs first in Hesiod (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 913</span>; comp. Horn. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymm. in Cer.</span> 56), the Homeric form being Persephoneia. But besides these forms of the name, we
                  also find Persephassa, Phersephassa, Persephatta, Phersephatta. Pherrephassa, Pherephatta,
                  and Phersephoneia, for which various etymologies have been proposed. The Latin Proserpina,
                  which is probably only a corruption of the Greek, was erroneously derived by the Romans
                  from <span style="font-style: italic">proscrpere</span>,"to shoot forth." (Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor</span>. 2.26.) Beingthe infernal goddess of death, she is also called a daughter of Zeus
                  and Styx (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.3.1</span> ); in Arcadia she was worshipped under the name of Despoena, and was called a daughter
                  of Poseidon, Hippius, and Demeter, and said to have been brought up by the Titan Anytus.
                  (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.37.3</span>, <span class="bibl">6</span>, <span class="bibl">25.5</span>.) Homer describes her as the wife of llades, and the formidable, venerable, and majestic
                  queen of the Shades, who exercises her power, and carries into effect the curses of
                  men upon the souls of the dead, along with her husband. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 10.494</span>, <span class="bibl">11.226</span>, <span class="bibl">385</span>, (134, <span class="bibl">Il. 9.457</span>, <span class="bibl">569</span>; comp. <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.9.15</span>.) Hence she is called by later writers <span style="font-style: italic">Juno Inferna, Auerna,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Stygia</span> (<span class="bibl">Verg. A. 6.138</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 14.114</span>), and the Erinnyes are said to have been daughters of her by Pluto. (Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 29. 6, 6, 70. 3.) Groves sacred to her are said by Homer to be in the western extremity
                  of the earth, on the frontiers of the lower world, which is itself called the house
                  of Persephone. (<span class="bibl">Od. 10.491</span>, <span class="bibl">509</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>The story of her being carried off by Pluto, against her will, is not mentioned by
                  Homer, who simply describes her as his wife and queen; and her abduction is first
                  mentioned by Hesiod (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 914</span>). Zeus, it is said, advised Pluto, who was in love with the beautiful Persephone,
                  to carry her off, as her mother, Demeter, was not likely to allow her daughter to
                  go down to Hades. (Comp. <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 146</span>.) Pluto accordingly carried her off while she was gathering flowers with Artemis
                  and Athena. (Comp. <span class="bibl">Diod. 5.3</span>.) Demeter, when she found her daughter had disappeared, searched for her all over
                  the earth with torches, until at length she discovered the place of her abode. Her
                  anger at the abduction obliged Zeus to request Pluto to send Persephone (or Cora,
                  i. e. the maiden or daughter) back. Pluto indeed complied with the request. but first
                  gave her a kernel of a pomegranate to eat, whereby she became doomed to the lower
                  world, and an agreement was made that Persephone should spend one third (later writers
                  say <span style="font-style: italic">one half</span>) of every year in Hades with Pluto, and the remaining two thirds with the gods above.
                  (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.5. 1</span>, &amp;c,; Or. <span style="font-style: italic">Met.</span> 5.565; comp. <span style="font-variant: small-caps">DEMETER.</span>) The place where Persephone was said to have been carried off, is different in the
                  various local traditions. The Sicilians, among whom her worship was probably introduced
                  by the Corinthian and Megarian colonists, believed that Pluto found her in the meadows
                  near Enna, and that the well Cyane arose on the spot where he descended with her into
                  the lower world. (<span class="bibl">Diod. 5.3</span>, &amp;c.; comp. Lydus, <span style="font-style: italic">De Mens.</span> p. 286; <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 4.422</span>.) The Cretans thought that their own island had been the scene of the rape (Schol.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">ad Hes. Theog.</span> 913), and the Eleusinians mentioned the Nysaean plain in Boeotia, and said that Persephone
                  had descended with Pluto into the lower world at the entrance of the western Oceanus.
                  Later accounts place the rape in Attica, near Athens (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Soph. Oed. Col.</span> 1590) or at Erineos near Eleusis (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.38.5</span>), or in the neighbourhood of Lerna (2.36.7 ; respecting other localities see Conon,
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Narr.</span> 15 ; Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Argon.</span> 1192; Spanheim, <span style="font-style: italic">ad Callim. Hymn. in Cer.</span> 9).
               </p> 
               <p>The story according to which Persephone spent one part of the year in the lower world,
                  and another with the gods above, made her, even with the ancients, the symbol of vegetation
                  which shoots forth in spring, and the power of which withdraws into the earth at other
                  seasons of the year. (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Theocrit.</span> 3.48.) Hence Plutarch identifies her with spring, and Cicero <span style="font-style: italic">De Nat. Deor.</span> 2.26) calls her the seed of the fruits of the field. (Comp. Lydus, <span style="font-style: italic">De Mes.</span> pp. 90, 284; Porphyr. <span style="font-style: italic">De Ant. Nymph.</span> p. 118. ed. Barnes.) In the mysteries of Eleusis, the return of Cora from the lower
                  world was regarded as the symbol of immortality, and hence she was frequently represented
                  on sarcophagi. In the mystical theories of the Orphics, and what are called the Platonists,
                  Cora is described as the all-pervading goddess of nature, who both produces and destroys
                  every thing (Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 29. 16), and she is therefore mentioned along, or identified with, other mystic divinities,
                  such as Isis, Rhea, Ge, Hestia, Pandora, Artemis, Hecate. (Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lyc.</span> 708, 1176; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Apollon. Rlod.</span> 3.467; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Theocrit.</span> 2.12 ; <span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 4.609</span>.) This mystic Persephone is further said to have become by Zeus the another of Dionysus,
                  Iacchus, Zagreus or Sabazius. (<span class="bibl">Hesych. sub voce</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ζαγρεύς</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Eurip. Or.</span> 952 ; Aristopll. <span style="font-style: italic">Ran.</span> 326; <span class="bibl">Diod. 4.4</span>; Arrian. <span style="font-style: italic">Exped. Al.</span> 2.16; Lydus <span style="font-style: italic">De Mens.</span> p. 198; Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">de Nat.</span> <span style="font-style: italic">Deor.</span> 3.23.) The surnames which are given to her by the poets, refer to her character as
                  queen of the lower world and of the dead, or to her symbolic meaning which we have
                  pointed out above. She was commonly worshipped along with Demeter, and with the same
                  mysteries, as for example, with Demeter Cabeiria in Boeotia. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 9.25.5</span>.) Her worship further is mentioned at Thebes, which Zeus is said to have given to
                  her as an acknowledgment for a favour she had bestowed on him (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Eurip. Phoen.</span> 687): in like manner Sicily was said to have been given to her at her wedding (<span class="bibl">Pind. N. 1.17</span>; <span class="bibl">Diod. 5.2</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Theocrit.</span> 15.14), and two festivals were celebrated in her honour in the island, the one at
                  the time of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e287">[Page 205]</span> sowing, and the other at the time of harvest. (

               <div class="biblfree">Diod. 5.4</div>
               <p>; </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Athen. 14.647</div>
               <p>.) The Eleusinian mysteries belonged to Demeter and Cora in common, and to her alone
                  were dedicated the mysteries celebrated at Athens in the month of Anthesterion. (Comp.
                  
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Paus. 1.31.1</div>
               <p>, &amp;c.) Temples of Persephone are mentioned at Corinth, Megara, Sparta, and at Locri
                  in the south of Italy. (
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Paus. 3.13.2</div>
               <p>; </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Liv. 29.8</div>
               <p>, </p>
               <div class="biblfree">18</div>
               <p>; Appian, 3.12.) In works of art Persephone is seen very frequently: she bears the
                  grave and severe character of an infernal Juno, or she appears as a mystical divinity
                  with a sceptre and a little box, but she was mostly represented in the act of being
                  carried off by Pluto. (

               </p> 
               <p>Another mythical personage of the name of Persephione, is called a daughter of Minyas,
                  and the mother of Chloris by Aniphion. (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Hom. Od.</span> 11.281.)
