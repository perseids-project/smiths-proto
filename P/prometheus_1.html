<div id="smith-bio">prometheus-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Προμηθεύς</span>), is sometimes called a Titan, though in reality he did not belong to the Titans,
                  but was only a son of the Titan lapetus (whence he is designated by the patronymic
                  <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἰαπετιονίδης</span>, <span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 528</span>; Apollon Rhod. 3.1087), by Clymene, so that he was a brother of Atlas, Menoetius,
                  and Epimetheus (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 507</span>). His name signifies "forethought," as that of his brother Epimetheus denotes "afterthought."
                  Others call Prometheus a son of Themis (Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span> 18), or of Uranus and Clymene, or of the Titan Eurymedon and HIera (Potter, <span style="font-style: italic">Comment. ad Lyc. Cass.</span> 1283; Eustath. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Horn.</span> p. 987). By Pandora, Hesione, or Axiothea, he is said to have been the father of
                  Deucalion (Aesch. <span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span> 560 ; Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lyc.</span> 1283; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Apollon. Rhod.</span> 2.1086), by Pyrrha or Clymene he begot Hellen (and according to some also Deucalion;
                  Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad </span> <span style="font-style: italic">Apollon. l.c.;</span> Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind. Ol.</span> 9.68), and by Celaeno he was the father of Lvcus and Chimareus (Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lyc.</span> 132, 219), while Herodotus (<span class="bibl">4.45</span>) calls his wife Asia. The following is an outline of the legends related of him by
                  the ancients. Once in the reign of Zeus, when gods and men were disputing with one
                  another at Mecone (afterwards Sicyon, Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Pind. Nem.</span> 9.123), Prometheus, with a view to deceive Zeus and rival him in prudence, cut up
                  a bull and divided it into two parts : he wrapped up the best parts and the intestines
                  in the skin, and at the top he placed the stomach, which is one of the worst parts,
                  while the second heap consisted of the bones covered with fat. When Zeus pointed out
                  to him how badly he had made the division, Prometheus desired him to choose, but Zeus,
                  in his anger, and seeing through the stratagem of Prometheus, chose the heap of bones
                  covered with the fat. The father of the gods avenged himself by withholding fire from
                  mortals, but Prometheus stole it in a hollow tube (<span style="font-style: italic">ferula,</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">νάρθηξ</span>, Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span> 110). Zeus now, in order to punish men, caused Hephaestus to mould a virgin, Pandora,
                  of earth, whom Athena adorned with all the charms calculated to entice mortals; Prometheus
                  himself was put in chains, and fastened to a pillar, where an eagle sent by Zeus consumed
                  in the daytime his liver, which, in every succeeding night, was restored again. Prometheus
                  was thus exposed to perpetual torture, but Heracles killed the eagle and delivered
                  the sufferer, with the consent of Zeus, who thus had an opportunity of allowing his
                  son to gain immortal fame (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 521</span>, &amp;c., <span style="font-style: italic">Op. et Dies,</span> 47, &amp;c. ; Ilygin. <span style="font-style: italic">Poet. Astr.</span> 2.15; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.5.11</span>). Prometheus had cautioned his brother Epimetheus against accepting any present from
                  Zeus, but Epimetheus, disregarding the advice, accepted Pandora, who was sent to him
                  by Zeus, through the mediation of Hermes. Pandora then lifted the lid of the vessel
                  in which the foresight of Prometheus had concealed all the evils which might torment
                  mortals in life. Diseases and sufferings of every kind now issued forth, but deceitful
                  hope alone remained behind (Hes. <span style="font-style: italic">Op. et Dies,</span> 83, &amp;c.; comp. <span class="bibl">Hor. Carm. 1.3.25</span>, &amp;c.). This is an outline of the legend about Prometheus, as contained in the poems
                  of Hesiod. Aeschylus, in his trilogy <span style="font-style: italic">Prometheus,</span> added various new features to it, for, according to him, Prometheus himself is an
                  immortal god, the friend of the human race, the giver of fire, the inventor of the
                  useful arts, an omniscient seer, an heroic sufferer, who is overcome by the superior
                  power of Zeus, but will not bend his inflexible mind. Although he himself belonged
                  to the Titans, he is nevertheless represented as having assisted Zeus against the
                  Titans (<span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span> 218), and he is further said to have opened the head of Zeus when the latter gave
                  birth to Athena (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.3.6</span>). But when Zeus succeeded to the kingdom of heaven, and wanted to extirpate the whole
                  race of man, the place of which he proposed to give to quite a new race of beings,
                  Prometheus prevented the execution of the scheme, and saved the human race from destruction
                  (<span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span> 228, 233). He deprived them of their knowledge of the future, and gave them hope
                  instead (248, &amp;c.). He further taught them the use of fire, made them acquainted with
                  architecture, astronomy, mathematics, the art of writing, the treatment of domestic
                  animals, navigation, medicine, the art of prophecy, working in metal, and all the
                  other arts (252, 445, &amp;c., 480, &amp;c.). But, as in all these things he had acted contrary
                  to the will of Zeus, the latter ordered Hephaestus to chain him to a rock in Scythia,
                  which was done in the presence of Cratos and Bia, two ministers of Zeus. In Scythia
                  he was visited by the Oceanides; Io also came to him, and he foretold her the wanderings
                  and sufferings which were yet in store for her, as well as her final relief (703,
                  &amp;c.). Hermes then likewise appears, and desires him to make known a prophecy which
                  was of great importance to Zeus, for Prometheus knew that by a certain woman Zeus
                  would beget a son, who was to dethrone his father, and Zeus wanted to have a more
                  accurate knowledge of this decree of fate. But Prometheus steadfastly refused to reveal
                  the decree of fate, whereupon Zeus, by a thunderbolt, sent Prometheus, together with
                  the rock to which he was chained, into Tartarus (<span class="bibl">Hor. Carm. 2.18</span>, 35). After the lapse of a long time, Prometheus returned to the upper world, to
                  endure a fresh course of suffering, for he was now fastened to mount Caucasus, and
                  tormented by an eagle, which every day, or every third day, devoured his liver, which
                  was restored again in the night (<span class="bibl">Apollon. 2.1247</span>, &amp;100.3.853; <span class="bibl">Strab. xv. p.688</span> ; Philostr. <span style="font-style: italic">Vit. Apoll.</span> 2.3; Hygin. <span style="font-style: italic">Poet. Astr.</span> 2.15; Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span> 1015, &amp;c.). This state of suffering was to last until some other god, of his own
                  accord, should take his place, and descend into Tartarus for him (<span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span> 1025). This came to pass when Cheiron, who had been incurably wounded by an arrow
                  of Heracles, desired to go <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e184">[Page 545]</span> into Hades; and Zeus allowed him to supply the place of Prometheus (
               <span class="biblfree">Apollod. 2.5.4</span>
               ; comp. <span style="font-variant: small-caps">CHEIRON</span>). According to others, however, Zeus himself delivered Prometheus, when at length
                  the Titan was prevailed upon to reveal to Zeus the decree of fate, that, if he should
                  become by Thetis the either of a son, that son should deprive him of the sovereignty.
                  (Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Eclog.</span> 6.42 ; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.13.5</span>; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 54</span>; comp. Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Pronm.</span> 167, &amp;100.376.)
               </p> 
               <p>There was also an account, stating that Prometheus had created men out of earth and
                  water, at the very beginning of the human race, or after the flood of Deucalion, when
                  Zeus is said to have ordered him and Athena to make nmen out of the mud, and the winds
                  to breathe life into them (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.7.1</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 1.81</span>; Etym. Mag. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Προμηθεύς</span>). Prometheus is said to have given to men something of all the qualities possessed
                  by the other animals (Horat <span style="font-style: italic">Carm.</span> 1.16. 13). The kind of earth out of which Prometheus formed men was shown in later
                  times near Panopeus in Phocis (<span class="bibl">Paus. 10.4.3</span>), and it was at his suggestion that Deucalion, when the flood approached, built a
                  ship, and carried into it provisions, that he and Pyrrha might be able to support
                  themselves during the calamity (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.7.2</span>). Prometheus, in the legend, often appears in connection with Athena, e. g., he is
                  said to have been punished on mount Caucasus for the criminal love he entertained
                  for her (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Apollon. Rhod.</span> 2.1249) and he is further said, with her assistance, to have ascended into heaven,
                  and there secretly to have lighted his torch at the chariot of Helios, in order to
                  bring down the fire to man (Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Eclog.</span> 6.42). At Athens Prometheus had a sanctuary in the Academy, from whence a torch-race
                  took place in honour of him (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.30.2</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Soph. Oed. Col.</span> 55; Harpocrat. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">λαμπάς</span>). The mythus of Prometheus is most minutely discussed by Welcker, in his <span class="titlem">Aeschylische Trilogie Prometheus</span>, Darmstadt, 1824; by Völcker, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythologie des Iapet. Geschlechtes,</span> 1824; and with especial reference to the Prometheus of Aeschylus, by Schoemann, <span style="font-style: italic">Des Aeschylus Gefesselter Prometheus.</span> Greifswald, 1844, and by Blackie, in the <span class="titlem">Class. Mus.</span> vol. v. p. 1, &amp;c., which contain a very sound explanation of the mythus, as developed
                  by Aeschylus.
