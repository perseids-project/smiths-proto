<div id="smith-bio">pan-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Πάν</span>), the great god of flocks and shepherds among the Greeks; his name is probably connected
                  with the verb <span lang="grc" class="foreign">πάω</span>. Lat. <span style="font-style: italic">pasco,</span> so that his name and character are perfectly in accordance with each other. Later
                  speculations, according to which Pan is the same as <span lang="grc" class="foreign">τὸ πᾶν</span>, or the universe, and the god the symbol of the universe, cannot be taken into consideration
                  here. He is described as a son of Hermes by the daughter of Dryops (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 7.34), by Callisto (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Theocr.</span> 1.3), by Oeneis or Thymbris (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.4.1</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Theocrit. l.c.</span>), or as the son of Hermes by Penelope, whom the god visited in the shape of a ram
                  (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 2.145</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Theocrit.</span> 1.123 ; <span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 2.43</span>), or of Penelope by Odysseus, or by all her suitors in common. (Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Georg.</span> 1.16; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph.</span> 766; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Theocrit.</span> 1.3.) Some again call him the son of Aether and Oeneis, or a Nereid, or a son of
                  Uranus and Ge. (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Theocrit.</span> 1.123; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph. l.c.</span>) From his being a grandson or great grandson of Cronos, he is called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Κρόνιος</span>. (<span class="bibl">Eur. Rh. 36</span>.) He was from his birth perfectly developed, and had the same appearance as afterwards,
                  that is, he had his horns, beard, puck nose, tail, goats' feet, and was covered with
                  hair, so that his mother ran away with fear when she saw him ; but Hermes carried
                  him into Olympus, where all (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">πάντες</span>) the gods were delighted with him, and especially Dionysus. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 7.36, &amp;c.; comp. <span class="bibl">Sil. Ital. 13.332</span>; Lucian, <span style="font-style: italic">Dial. Deor.</span> 22.) He was brought up by nymphs. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.30.2</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>The principal seat of his worship was Arcadia and from thence his name and his worship
                  afterwards spread over other parts of Greece; and at Athens his worship was not introduced
                  till the time of the battle of Marathon. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.26.2</span>; <span class="bibl">Verg. Ecl. 10.26</span>; Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">Frag.</span> 63, ed. Boeckh.; <span class="bibl">Hdt. 2.145</span>.) In Arcadia he was the god of forests, pastures, flocks, and shepherds, and dwelt
                  in grottoes (<span class="bibl">Eur. Ion 501</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 14.515</span>), wandered on the summits of mountains and rocks, and in valleys, either amusing
                  himself with the chase, or leading the dances of the nymphs. (Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Pers.</span> 448; Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 7.6, 13, 20 ; <span class="bibl">Paus. 8.42.2</span>.) As the god of flocks, both of wild and tame animals, it was his province to increase
                  them and guard them (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 7.5; <span class="bibl">Paus. 8.38.8</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 2.271</span>, 277 ; <span style="font-style: italic">Virg. Eclog.</span> 1.33); but he was also a hunter, and hunters owed their success to him, who at the
                  same time might prevent their being successful. (Hesych. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀγρεύς</span>.) In Arcadia hunters used to scourge the statue, if they hunted in vain (Theocrit.
                  7.107); during the heat of mid day he used to slumber, and was very indignant when
                  any one disturbed him. (Theocrit. 1.16.) As god of flocks, bees also were under his
                  protection, as well as the coast where fishermen carried on their pursuit. (Theocrit.
                  5.15; <span style="font-style: italic">Anthol. Palat.</span> 6.239, 10.10.) As the god of every thing connected with pastoral life, he was fond
                  of music, and the inventor of the syrinx or shepherd's flute, which he himself played
                  in a masterly manner, and in which he instructed others also, such as Daphnis. (Hom.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 7.15 ; Theocrit. 1.3; <span style="font-style: italic">Anthol. Pa</span>la<span style="font-style: italic">t.</span> 9.237, 10.11; <span class="bibl">Verg. Ecl. 1.32</span>, <span class="bibl">4.58</span>; Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Edloq.</span> 5.20.) He is thus said to have loved the poet Pindar, and to have sung and danced
                  his lyric songs, in return for which Pindar erected to him a sanctuary in front of
                  his house. (<span class="bibl">Pind. P. 3.139</span>, with the Schol.; <span class="bibl">Plut. Num. 4</span>.) Pan, like other gods who dwelt in forests, was dreaded by travellers to whom he
                  sometimes appeared, and whom he startled with a sudden awe or terror. (<span class="bibl">Eur. Rh. 36</span>.) Thus when Pheidippides, the Athenian, was sent to Sparta to solicit its aid against
                  the Persians, Pan accosted him, and promised to terrify the barbarians, if the Athenians
                  would worship him. (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 6.105</span> ; <span class="bibl">Paus. 8.54.5</span>, <span class="bibl">1.28.4</span>.) He is said to have had a terrific voice (<span class="bibl">V. Fl. 3.31</span>), and by it to have frightened the Titans in their fight with the gods. (Eratosh.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Catast.</span> 27.) It seems that this feature, namely, his fondness of noise and riot, was the
                  cause of his being considered as the minister and companion of Cybele and Dionysus.
                  (<span class="bibl">V. Fl. 3.47</span>; Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">Fragm.</span> 63, ed. Boeckh; Lucian, <span style="font-style: italic">Dial. Deor.</span> 22.) He was at the same time believed to be possessed of prophetic powers, and to
                  have even instructed Apollo in this art. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.4.1</span>.) While roaming in his forests he fell in love with Echo, by whom or by Peitho he
                  became the father of lynx. His love of Syrinx, after whom he named his flute, is well
                  known from Ovid (<span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 1.691</span>, &amp;c.; comp. Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Eclog.</span> 2.31; and about his other amours see <span style="font-style: italic">Georg.</span> 3.391; <span class="bibl">Macr. 5.22</span>). Fir-trees were sacred to him, as the nymph Pitys, whom he loved, had been metamorphosed
                  into that tree (Propert. 1.18. 20), and the sacrifices offered to him consisted of
                  cows, rams, lambs, milk, and honey. (Theocrit. 5.58; <span style="font-style: italic">Anthol. Pa</span>la<span style="font-style: italic">t.</span> 2.630, 697, 6.96, 239, 7.59.) Sacrifices were also offered to him in common with
                  Dionysus and the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e271">[Page 107]</span> nymphs. (
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Paus. 2.24.7</div>
               <p>; <span style="font-style: italic">Anthol. Palat.</span> 6.154.) The various epithets which are given him by the poets refer either to his
                  singular appearance, or are derived from the names of the places in which he was worshipped.
                  Sanctuaries and temples of this god are frequently mentioned, especially in Arcadia,
                  as at Heraea, on the Nomian hill near Lycosura, on mount Parthenius (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.26.2</span>, <span class="bibl">38.8</span>, <span class="bibl">54.5</span>), at Megalopolis (8.30.2, 3.31.1), near Acacesium, where a perpetual fire was burning
                  in his temple, and where at the same time there was an ancient oracle, at which the
                  nymph Erato had been his priestess (8.37.8, &amp;c.), at Troezene (2.32.5), on the well
                  of Eresinus, between Argos and Tegea (2.24.7), at Sicyon 2.10.2), at Oropus (1.34.2),
                  at Athens (1.28.4; <span class="bibl">Hdt. 6.105</span>), near Marathon (1.32. in fin.), in the island of Psyttaleia (1.36.2 ; Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Pers.</span> 448), in the Corycian grotto near mount Parnassus (10.32.5), and at Homala in Thessaly.
                  (Theocrit. 7.103.)
               </p> 
               <p>The Romans identified with Pan their own god Inuus, and sometimes also Faunus. Respecting
                  the plural (Panes) or beings with goat's feet, see <span style="font-variant: small-caps">SATYRI</span>. In works of art Pan is represented as a voluptuous and sensual being, with horns,
                  puck-nose, and goat's feet, sometimes in the act of dancing, and sometimes playing
                  on the syrinx. (Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> ii. p. 161, &amp;c.)
