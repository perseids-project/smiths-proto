               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Πρωτεύς</span>), the prophetic old man of the sea (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἅλιος γέρων</span>), occurs in the earliest legends as a subject of Poseidon, and is described as seeing
                  through the whole depth of the sea, and tending the flocks (the seals) of Poseidon
                  (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 4.365</span>, <span class="bibl">385</span>, <span class="bibl">400</span>; <span class="bibl">Verg. G. 4.392</span> ; Theocr. 2.58; <span class="bibl">Hor. Carm. 1.2.7</span>; Philostr. <span style="font-style: italic">Icon.</span> 2.17). He resided in the island of Pharos, at the distance of one day's journey from
                  the river Aegyptus (Nile), whence he is also called the Egyptian (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 4.355</span>, <span class="bibl">385</span>). Virgil, however, instead of Pharos, mentions the island of Carpathos, between Crete
                  and Rhodes (<span style="font-style: italic">Georg.</span> 4.387; comp. <span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 2.676</span>), whereas, according to the same poet, Proteus was born in Thessaly (<span style="font-style: italic">Georg.</span> 4.390, comp. <span style="font-style: italic">Ace.</span> 11.262). His life is described as follows. At midday he rises from the flood, and
                  sleeps in the shadow of the rocks of the coast, and around him lie the monsters of
                  the deep (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Od.</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e117">[Page 554]</span> 4.400; 
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Verg. G. 4.395</div>
               <p>). Any one wishing to compel him to foretell the future, was obliged to catch hold
                  of him at that time; he, indeed, had the power of assuming every possible shape, in
                  order to escape the necessity of prophesying, but whenever he saw that his eudeavours
                  were of no avail, he resumed his usual appearance, and told the truth (

               <p>, &amp;100.455, &amp;c.; Ov. <span style="font-style: italic">Art. Am.</span> i. <span style="font-style: italic">761, Fast.</span> 1.369; Philostr. <span style="font-style: italic">Vit. Apoll.</span> 1.4). When he had finished his prophecy he returned into the sea (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 4.570</span>). Homer (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 4.365</span>) ascribes to him one daughter, Eidothea, but Strabo (<span class="bibl">x. p.472</span>) mentions Cabeiro as a second, aud Zenodotus (apud <span style="font-style: italic">Eustath. ad Hom.</span> p. 1500) mentions Eurynome instead of Eidothea. He is sometimes represented as riding
                  through the sea, in a chariot drawn by Hippocampae. (Virg. <span style="font-style: italic">Georg.</span> 4.389.)
               </p> 
               <p>Another set of traditions describes Proteus as a son of Poseidon, and as a king of
                  Egypt, who had two sons, Telegonus and Polygonus or Tmolus. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.5.9</span>; Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lyc.</span> 124.) Diodorus however observes (1.62), that only the Greeks called him Proteus,
                  and that the Egyptians called him Cetes. His wife is called Psamathe (<span class="bibl">Eur. Hel. 7</span>) or Torone (Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lyc.</span> 115), and, besides the above mentioned sons, Theoclymenus and Theonoe are likewise
                  called his children. (<span class="bibl">Eur. Hel. 9</span>, <span class="bibl">13</span>.) He is said to have hospitably received Dionysus during his wanderings (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.5.1</span>), and Hermes brought to him Helena after her abduction ( <span class="bibl">Eur. Hel. 46</span>), or, according to others, Proteus himself took her from Paris, gave to the lover
                  a phantom, and restored the true Helen to Menelaus after his return from Troy. (Tzetz.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lyc.</span> 112, 820; <span class="bibl">Hdt. 2.112</span>, <span class="bibl">118</span>.) The story further relates that Proteus was originally an Egyptian, but that he
                  went to Thrace and there married Torone. But as his sons by her used great violence
                  towards strangers, he prayed to his father Poseidon to carry him back to Egypt. Poseidon
                  accordingly opened a chasm in the earth in Pallene, and through a passage passing
                  through the earth under the sea he led him back into Egypt. (Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lyc.</span> 124; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 686</span>.) A second personage of the name of Proteus is mentioned by Apollodorus (<span class="bibl">2.1.5</span>) among the sons of Aegyptus.
