<div id="smith-bio">poseidon-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Ποσειδῶν</span>), the god of the Mediterranean sea. His name seems to be connected with <span lang="grc" class="foreign">πότος, πόντος</span> and <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ποταμός</span>, according to which he is the god of the fluid element. (Müller, <span style="font-style: italic">Proleg.</span> p. 290.) He was a son of Cronos and Rhea (whence he is called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Κρόνιος</span> and by Latin poets <span style="font-style: italic">Saturnius,</span> <span class="bibl">Pind. O. 6.48</span>; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 5.799</span>.) He was accordingly a brother of Zeus, Hades, Hera, Hestia and Demeter, and it was
                  determined by lot that he should rule over the sea. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 14.156</span>, <span class="bibl">15.187</span>, &amp;c.; Hes. <span style="font-style: italic">Theog,</span> 456.) Like his brothers and sisters, he was, after his birth, swallowed by his father
                  Cronos, but thrown up again. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.1.5</span>, <span class="bibl">2.1</span>.) According to others, he was concealed by Rhea, after his birth, among a flock of
                  lambs, and his mother pretended to have given birth to a young horse, which she gave
                  to Cronos to devour. A well in the neighbourhood of Mantineia, where this is said
                  to have happened, was believed, from this circumstance, to have derived the name of
                  the "Lamb's Well," or Arne. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.8.2</span>.) According to Tzetzes (<span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph.</span> 644) the nurse of Poseidon bore the name of Arne; when Cronos searched after his
                  son, Arne is said to have declared that she knew not where he was, and from her the
                  town of Arne was believed to have received its name. According to others, again, he
                  was brought up by the Telchines at the request of Rhea. (<span class="bibl">Diod. 5.55</span>.) In the earliest poems, Poseidon is described as indeed equal to Zeus in dignity,
                  but weaker. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 8.210</span>, <span class="bibl">15.165</span>, <span class="bibl">186</span>, <span class="bibl">209</span>; comp. 13.355, <span class="bibl">Od. 13.148</span>.) Hence we find him angry when Zeus, by haughty words, attempts to intimidate him;
                  nay, he even threatens his mightier brother, and once he conspired with Hera and Athena
                  to put him into chains (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 15.176</span>, &amp;c., 212, &amp;c.; comp. 1.400.); but, on the other hand, we also find him yielding
                  and submissive to Zeus (8.440). The palace of Poseidon was in the depth of the sea
                  near Aegae in Euboea (13.21; <span class="bibl">Od. 5.381</span>), where he kept his horses with brazen hoofs and golden manes. With these horses
                  he rides in a chariot over the waves of the sea, which become smooth as he appreaches,
                  and the monsters of the deep recognise him and play around his chariot. (<span class="bibl">Il. 13.27</span>, comp. <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 5.817</span>, &amp;c., 1.147; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 3.1240</span>, &amp;c.) Generally he himself put his horses to his chariot, but sometimes he was assisted
                  by Amphitrite. (<span class="bibl">Apollon. 1.1158</span>, <span class="bibl">4.1325</span>; <span class="bibl">Eur. Andr. 1011</span>; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 5.817</span>.) But although he generally dwelt in the sea, still he also appears in Olympus in
                  the assembly of the gods. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 8.440</span>, <span class="bibl">13.44</span>, <span class="bibl">352</span>, <span class="bibl">15.161</span>, <span class="bibl">190</span>, <span class="bibl">20.13</span>.) Poseidon in conjunction with Apollo is said to have built the walls of Troy for
                  Laomedon (7.452; <span style="font-style: italic">Eurip. Androm.</span> 1014),whence Troy is called <span style="font-style: italic">Neptunia Pergama</span> (Neptunus and Poseidon being identified, <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 1.525</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Heroid.</span> 3.151; comp. <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 6.810</span>.) Accordingly, although he was otherwise well disposed towards the Greeks, yet he
                  was jealous of the wall which the Greeks built around their own ships, and he lamented
                  the inglorious manner in which the walls <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e200">[Page 506]</span> erected by himself fell by the hands of the Greeks. (
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Hom. Il. 12.17</div>
               <p>, </p>
               <div class="biblfree">28</div>
               <p>, &amp;c.) When Poseidon and Apollo had built the walls of Troy, Laomedon refused to give
                  them the reward which had been stipulated, and even dismissed them with threats (21.443);
                  but Poseidon sent a marine monster, which was on the point of devouring Laomedon's
                  daughter, when it was killed by Heracles. 2.5 § 9.) For this reason Poseidon like
                  Hera bore an implacable hatred against the Trojans, from which not even Aeneas was
                  excepted (
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Hom. Il. 20.293</div>
               <p>, &amp;c.; comp. </p>

               <div class="biblfree">20.312</div>
               <p>, &amp;c.), and took an active part in the war against Troy, in which he sided with the
                  Greeks, sometimes witnessing the contest as a spectator from the heights of Thrace,
                  and sometimes interfering in person, assuming the appearance of a mortal hero and
                  encouraging the Greeks, while Zeus favoured the Trojans. (<span style="font-style: italic">Il</span>. 13.12, &amp;c., 44, &amp;c., 209, 351, 357, 677, 14.136, 510.) When Zeus permitted the gods
                  to assist whichever party they pleased, Poseidon joining the Greeks, took part in
                  the war, and caused the earth to tremble; he was opposed by Apollo, who, however,
                  did not like to fight against his uncle. (<span style="font-style: italic">Il</span>. 20.23, 34, 57, 67, 21.436, &amp;c.) In the Odyssey, Poseidon appears hostile to Odysseus,
                  whom he prevents from returning home in consequence of his having blinded Polyphemus,
                  a son of Poseidon by the nymph Thoosa. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 1.20</span>, <span class="bibl">68</span>, <span class="bibl">5.286</span>, &amp;c., 366, &amp;c., 423, 11.101, &amp;e., 13.125; <span class="bibl">Ov. Tr. 1.2. 9</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>Being the ruler of the sea (the Mediterranean), he is described as gathering clouds
                  and calling forth storms, but at the same he has it in his power to grant a successful
                  voyage and save those who are in danger, and all other marine divinities are subject
                  to him. As the sea surrounds and holds the earth, he himself is described as the god
                  who holds the earth (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">γαιήοχος</span>), and who has it in his power to shake the earth (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ενοσίχθων, κινητὴρ γᾶς</span>). He was further regarded as the creator of the horse, and was accordingly believed
                  to have taught men the art of managing horses by the bridle, and to have been the
                  originator and protector of horse races. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 23.307</span>, <span class="bibl">584</span>; <span class="bibl">Pind. P. 6.50</span> ; Soph. <span style="font-style: italic">Oed. Col.</span> 712, &amp;c.) Hence he was also represented on horseback, or riding in a chariot drawn
                  by two or four horses, and is designated by the epithets <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἵππιος, ἵππειος</span>, or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἵππιος ἄναξ.</span> (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.30.4</span>, <span class="bibl">8.25.5</span>, <span class="bibl">6.20.8</span>, <span class="bibl">8.37.7</span> ; <span class="bibl">Eur. Phoen. 1707</span>; comp. <span class="bibl">Liv. 1.9</span>, where he is called <span style="font-style: italic">equester.</span>) In consequence of his connection with the horse, he was regarded as the friend of
                  charioteers (<span class="bibl">Pind. O. 1.63</span>, &amp;c.; Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lyc.</span> 156), and he even metamorphosed himself into a horse, for the purpose of deceiving
                  Demeter. The common tradition about Poseidon creating the horse is as follows : --
                  when Poseidon and Athena disputed as to which of them should give the name to the
                  capital of Attica, the gods decided, that it should receive its name from him who
                  should bestow upon man the most useful gift. Poseidon their created the horse, and
                  Athena called forth the olive tree, for which the honour was conferred upon her. (Serv.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Georg.</span> 1.12.) According to others, however, Poseidon did not create the horse in Attica,
                  but in Thessaly, where he also gave the famous horses to Peleus. (Lucan, <span style="font-style: italic">PPhars.</span> 6.396, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 23.277</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.13.5</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>The symbol of Poseidon's power was the trident, or a spear with three points, with
                  which he used to shatter rocks, to call forth or subdue storms, to shake the earth,
                  and the like. Herodotus (<span class="bibl">2.50</span>, <span class="bibl">4.188</span>) states, that the name and worship of Poseidon was imported to the Greeks from Libya,
                  but he was probably a divinity of Pelasgian origin, and originally a personification
                  of the fertilising power of water, from which the transition to regarding him as the
                  god of the sea was not difficult. It is a remarkable circumstance that in the legends
                  about this divinity there are many in which he is said to have disputed the possession
                  of certain countries with other gods. Thus, in order to take possession of Attica,
                  he thrust his trident into the ground on the acropolis, where a well of sea-water
                  was thereby called forth; but Athena created the olive tree, and the two divinities
                  disputed, until the gods assigned Attica to Athena. Poseidon, indignant at this, caused
                  the country to be inundated. (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 8.55</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.14.1</span> ; <span class="bibl">Paus. 1.24.3</span>, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 164</span>.) With Athena he also disputed the possession of Troezene, and at the command of
                  Zeus he shared the place with her. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.30.6</span> ) With Helios he disputed the sovereignty of Corinth, which along with the isthmus
                  was adjudged to him, while Helios received the acropolis. (2.1.6.) With Hera he disputed
                  the possession of Argolis, which was adjudged to the former by Inachus, Cephissus,
                  and Asterion, in consequence of which Poseidon caused the rivers of these river-gods
                  to be dried up. (2.15.5, 22.5; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.1.4</span>.) With Zeus, lastly, he disputed the possession of Aegina, and with Dionysus that
                  of Naxos. (Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Sympos.</span> 9.6.) At one time Delphi belonged to him in common with Ge, but Apollo gave him Calauria
                  as a compensation for it. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.33.2</span>, <span class="bibl">10.5.3</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 3.1243</span>, with the Schol.) The following legends also deserve to be mentioned. In conjunction
                  with Zeus he fought against Cronos and the Titans (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.2.1</span>), and in the contest with the Giants he pursued Polybotes across the sea as far as
                  Cos, and there killed him by throwing the island upon him. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.6.2</span>; <span class="bibl">Paus. 1.2.4</span>.) He further crushed the Centaurs when they were pursued by Heracles, under a mountain
                  in Leucosia, the island of the Seirens. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.5.4</span>.) He sued together with Zeus for the hand of Thetis, but he withdrew when Themis
                  prophesied that the son of Thetis would be greater than his father. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.13.5</span>; Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lyc.</span> 178.) When Ares had been caught in the wonderful net by Hephaestus, the latter set
                  him free at the request of Poseidon (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 8.344</span>, &amp;c.), but Poseidon afterwards brought a charge against Ares before the Areiopagus,
                  for having killed his son Halirrhothius. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.14.2</span>.) At the request of Minos, king of Crete, Poseidon caused a bull to rise from the
                  sea, which the king promised to sacri fice; but when Minos treacherously concealed
                  the animal among a herd of oxen, the god punished Minos by causing his daughter Pasiphae
                  to fall in love with the bull. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.3</span>, &amp;c.) Periclymenus, who was either a son or a grandson of Poseidon, received from
                  him the power of as-suming various forms. (1.9.9, 3.6.8.)
               </p> 
               <p>Poseidon was married to Amphitrite, by whom he had three children, Triton, Rhode,
                  and Benthesicyme (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 930</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.4.5</span>, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e393">[Page 507]</span> 3.15.4); but he had besides a vast number of children by other divinities and mortal
                  women. He is mentioned by a variety of surnames, either in allusion to the many legends
                  related about him, or to his nature as the god of the sea. His worship extended over
                  all Greece and southern Italy, but he was more especially revered in Peloponnesus
                  (which is hence called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">οἰκητήριον Ποσειδῶνος</span>) and in the Ionic coast towns. The sacrifices offered to him generally consisted
                  of black and white bulls (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 3.6</span>, <span class="bibl">Il. 20.404</span>; <span class="bibl">Pind. O. 13.98</span>; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 5.237</span>); but wild boars and rams were also sacrificed to him. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 11.130</span>, &amp;c., 23.277; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 3.119</span>.) In Argolis bridled horses were thrown into the well Deine as a sacrifice to him
                  (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.7.2</span>), and horse and chariot races were held in his honour on the Corinthian isthmus.
                  (<span class="bibl">Pind. N. 5.66</span>, &amp;c.) The Panionia, or the festival of all the lonians near Mycale, was celebrated
                  in honour of Poseidon. (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 1.148</span>.) In works of art, Poseidon may be easily recognised by his attributes, the dolphin,
                  the horse, or the trident (<span class="bibl">Paus. 10.36.4</span>), and he was frequently represented in groups along with Amphitrite, Tritons, Nereids,
                  dolphins, the Dioscuri, Palaemon, Pegasus, Bellerophontes, Thalassa, Ino, and Galene.
                  (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.1.7</span>.) His figure does not present the majestic calm which characterises his brother Zeus;
                  but as the state of the sea is varying, so also is the god represented sometimes in
                  violent agitation, and sometimes in a state of repose. (Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> i. p. 26.) It must be observed that the Romans identified Poseidon with their own
                  Neptunus, and that accordingly the attributes belonging to the former are constantly
                  transferred by the Latin poets to the latter.
