               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="label">Ἅιδης</span>) or PLUTON (<span lang="grc" class="label">Πλούτων</span> or poetically <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀΐδης, Ἀἵδωνεύς</span> and <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Πλουτεν́ς</span>), the god of the lower world. Plato (<span style="font-style: italic">Cratyl.</span> p. 403) observes that people preferred calling him Pluton (the giver of wealth) to
                  pronouncing the dreaded name of Hades or Aides. Hence we find that in ordinary life
                  and in the mysteries the name Pluton became generally established, while the poets
                  preferred the ancient name Aides or the form Pluteus. The etymology of Hades is uncertain:
                  some derive it from <span lang="grc" class="foreign">α-ιδεῖν</span>, whence it would signify "the god who makes invisible," and others from <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἅδω</span> or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">χάδω</span>; so that Hades would mean "the allembracer," or " all-receiver." The Roman poets
                  use the names Dis, Orcus, and Tartarus as synonymous with Pluton, for the god of the
                  lower world.
               </p> 
               <p>Hades is a son of Cronus and Rhea, and a brother of Zeus and Poseidon. He was married
                  to Persephone, the daughter of Demeter. In the division of the world among the three
                  brothers, Hades obtained " the darkness of night," the abode of the shades, over which
                  he rules. (Apollod. i. ]. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e98">[Page 319]</span> § 5, 2.1.) Hence he is called the infernal Zeus (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ζεὺς καταχθόνιος</span>), or the king of the shades (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἂναε ἐνέρων</span>, <span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 9.457</span>, <span class="bibl">20.61</span>. 15.187, &amp;c.). As, however, the earth and Olympus belonged to the three brothers
                  in common, he might ascend Olympus, as he did at the time when he was wounded by Heracles.
                  (<span class="bibl">Il. 5.395</span>; comp. <span class="bibl">Paus. 6.25.3</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.7.3</span>; ind. <span style="font-style: italic">Ol.</span> 9.31.) But when Hades was in his own kingdom, he was quite unaware of what was going
                  on either on earth or in Olympus (<span class="bibl">Il. 20.61</span>, &amp;c.), and it was only the oaths and curses of men that reached his ears, as they
                  reached those of the Erinnyes. He possessed a helmet which rendered the wearer invisible
                  (<span class="bibl">Il. 5.845</span>), and later traditions stated that this helmet was given him as a present by the
                  Cyclopes after their delivery from Tartarus. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.2.1</span>.) Ancient story mentions both gods and men who were honoured by Hades with the temporary
                  use of this helmet. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.6.2</span>, <span class="bibl">2.4.2</span>.) His character is described as fierce and inexorable, whence of all the gods he
                  was most hated by mortals. (<span class="bibl">Il. 9.158</span>.) He kept the gates of the lower world closed (whence he is called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Πυλάρτης</span>, <span class="bibl">Il. 8.367</span>; comp. <span class="bibl">Paus. 5.20.1</span>.; Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 17. 4), that no shade might be able to escape or return to the region of light. When
                  mortals invoked him, they struck the earth with their hands (<span class="bibl">Il. 9.567</span>), and the sacrifices which were offered to him and Persephone consisted of black
                  male and female sheep, and the person who offered the sacrifice had to turn away his
                  face. (<span class="bibl">Od. 10.527</span>; Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Georg.</span> 2.380.)
               </p> 
               <p>The ensign of his power was a staff, with which, like Hermes, he drove the shades
                  into the lower world (<span class="bibl">Pind. O. 9.35</span>), where he had his palace and shared his throne with his consort Persephone. When
                  he carried off Persephone from the upper world, he rode in a golden chariot drawn
                  by four black immortal horses. (Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Argon.</span> 1192, <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 17. 14; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 5.404</span>; Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Cer.</span> 19; Claudian, <span style="font-style: italic">Rapt. Proserp.</span> i. in fin.) Besides these horses he was also believed to have herds of oxen in the
                  lower world and in the island of Erytheia, which were attended to by Menoetius. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.5</span>. §§ 10, 12.) Like the other gods, he was not a faithful husband; the Furies are called
                  his daughters (<span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 1.86</span>); the nymph Mintho, whom he loved, was metamorphosed by Persephone into the plant
                  called mint (<span class="bibl">Strab. viii. p.344</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 10.728</span>), and the nymph Leuce, with whom he was likewise in love, was changed by him after
                  her death into a white poplar, and transferred to Elysium. (Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Eclog.</span> 7.61.) Being the king of the lower world, Pluton is the giver of all the blessings
                  that come from the earth: he is the possessor and giver of all the metals contained
                  in the earth, and hence his name Pluton. (Hes. <span style="font-style: italic">Op. et Dies,</span> 435; Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span> 805; <span class="bibl">Strab. iii. p.147</span>; Lucian, <span style="font-style: italic">Tim.</span> 21.) He bears several surnames referring to his ultimately assembling all mortals
                  in his kingdom, and bringing them to rest and peace; such as Polydegmon, Polydectes,
                  Clymenus, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Παγκοίτης</span>, &amp;c. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Cer.</span> 9; Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span> 153 ; Soph. <span style="font-style: italic">Antig.</span> 811; <span class="bibl">Paus. 2.35.7</span>.) Hades was worshipped throughout Greece and Italy. In Elis he had a sacred enclosure
                  and a temple, which was opened only once in every year (<span class="bibl">Paus. 6.25.3</span>) ; and we further know that lie had temples at Pylos Triphyliacus, near Mount Menthe,
                  between Tralles and Nysa, at Athens in the grove of the Erinnyes, and at Olympia.
                  (<span class="bibl">Strab. iii. p.344</span>, xiv. p. 649 <span class="bibl">Paus. 1.28.6</span>, <span class="bibl">5.20.1</span>.) We possess few representations of this divinity, but in those which still exist,
                  he resembles his brothers Zeus and Poseidon, except that his hair falls down his forehead,
                  and that the majesty of his appearance is dark and gloomy. His ordinary attributes
                  are the key of Hades and Cerberus. (Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> i. p. 72, &amp;c.)
               </p> 
               <p>In Homer Aides is invariably the name of the god; but in later times it was transferred
                  to his house, his abode or kingdom, so that it became a name for the lower world itself.
                  We cannot enter here into a description of the conceptions which the ancients formed
                  of the lower world, for this discussion belongs to mythical geography.
