               <p><span lang="grc" class="persName">Ἑστία</span>, (Ion. <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἱστίη</span>), the goddess of the hearth, or rather the fire burning on the hearth, was regarded
                  as one of the twelve great gods, and accordingly as a daughter of Cronus and Rhea.
                  According to the common tradition, she was the first-born daughter of Rhea, and was
                  therefore the first of the children that was swallowed by Cronus. (<span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 453</span>, &amp;c.; Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Ven.</span> 22; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.1.5</span>.) She was, like Artemis and Athena, a maiden divinity, and when Apollo and Poseidon
                  sued for her hand, she swore by the head of Zeus to remain a virgin for ever (Hom.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Ven.</span> 24, &amp;c.), and in this character it was that her sacrifices consisted of cows which
                  were only one year old. The connection between Hestia and Apollo and Poseidon, which
                  is thus alluded to in the legend, appears also in the temple of Delphi, where the
                  three divinities were worshipped in common, and Hestia and Poseidon appeared together
                  also at Olympia. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 5.26.26</span>, <span class="bibl">10.5.3</span>; Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 31.2.) As the hearth was looked upon as the sacred centre of domestic life, so Hestia
                  was the goddess of domestic life and the giver of all domestic happiness and blessings,
                  and as such she was believed to dwell in the inner part of every house (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Ven.</span> 30; Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Del.</span> 325, <span style="font-style: italic">in Cer.</span> 129), and to have invented the art of building houses. (<span class="bibl">Diod. 5.68</span>; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 735</span>.) In this respect she appears often together with Hermes, who was likewise a <span style="font-style: italic">deus penetralis,</span> as protecting the works of man. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 32.10: <span class="bibl">Paus. 10.11.3</span>.) As the hearth <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e127">[Page 445]</span> of a house is at the same time the altar on which sacrifices are offered to the domestic
                  gods (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἑστιοῦχοι</span> or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἐφέστιοι</span>), Hestia was looked upon as presiding at all sacrifices, and, as the goddess of the
                  sacred fire of the altar, she had a share in the sacrifices in all the temples of
                  the gods. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Ven.</span> 31.) Hence when sacrifices were offered, she was invoked first, and the first part
                  of the sacrifice was offered to her. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 32.5; <span class="bibl">Pind. N. 11.5</span>; Plat. <span style="font-style: italic">Cratyl.</span> p. 401d. ; <span class="bibl">Paus. 5.14.5</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Aristoph. Vesp.</span> 842 ; Hesych. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀφ̓ ἑστίας ἀρχόμενος</span>.) Solemn oaths were sworn by the goddess of the hearth, and the hearth itself was
                  the sacred asylum where suppliants implored the protection of the inhabitants of the
                  house. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 14.159</span>; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1579</span>.) A town or city is only an extended family, and therefore had likewise its sacred
                  hearth, the symbol of an harmonious community of citizens and of a common worship.
                  This public hearth usually existed in the prytaneium of a town, where the goddess
                  had her especial sanctuary (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">Δάλαμος</span>), under the name of <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Πρυτανῖτις</span>, with a statue and the sacred hearth. There the prytanes offered sacrifices to her,
                  on entering upon their office, and there, as at a private hearth, Hestia protected
                  the suppliants. As this public hearth was the sacred asylum in every town, the state
                  usually received its guests and foreign ambassadors there, and the prytanes had to
                  act the part of hosts. When a colony was sent out, the emigrants took the fire which
                  was to burn on the hearth of their new home from that of the mother town. (<span class="bibl">Pind. N. 11.1</span>, &amp;c., with the Scholiast; Parthen. <span style="font-style: italic">Erot.</span> 18; <span class="bibl">Dionys. A. R. 2.65</span>.) If ever the fire of her hearth became extinct, it was not allowed to be lighted
                  again with ordinary fire, but either by fire produced by friction, or by burning glasses
                  drawing fire from the sun. The mystical speculations of later times proceeded from
                  the simple ideas of the ancients, and assumed a sacred hearth not only in the centre
                  of the earth, but even in that of the universe, and confounded Hestia in various ways
                  with other divinities, such as Cybele, Gaea, Demeter, Persephone, and Artemis. (Orph.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 83; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">de Plac. Philos. 3, 11, Numa,</span> 11.) There were but few special temples of Hestia in Greece, as in reality every
                  prytaneum was a sanctuary of the goddess, and as a portion of the sacrifices, to whatever
                  divinity they were offered, belonged to her. There was, however, a separate temple
                  of Hestia at Hermione, though it contained no image of her, but only an altar. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.35.2</span>.) Her sacrifices consisted of the primitiae of fruit, water, oil, wine, and cows
                  of one year old. (Hesych. <span style="font-style: italic">l.c. ;</span> Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 31.3, 32.6; <span class="bibl">Pind. N. 11.6</span>.) The Romans worshipped the same goddess, or rather the same ideas embodied in her,
                  under the name of Vesta, which is in reality identical with Hestia; but as the Roman
                  worship of Vesta differed in several points from that of Hestia in Greece, we treat
                  of Vesta in a separate article.
