<div id="smith-bio">hephaestus-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="persName">Ἥφαιστος</span>), the god of fire, was, according to the Homeric account, the son of Zeus and Hera.
                  (<span class="bibl">Il. 1.578</span>, <span class="bibl">14.338</span>, <span class="bibl">18.396</span>, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e85">[Page 384]</span> 21.332, 
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Od. 8.312</div>
               <p>.) Later traditions state that he had no father, and that Hera gave birth to him independent
                  of Zeus, as she was jealous of Zeus having given birth to Athena independent of her.
                  (
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Apollod. 1.3.5</div>
               <p>; Hygin. <span style="font-style: italic">Fab.</span> Praef.) This, however, is opposed to the common stor, that Hephaestus split the head
                  of Zeus, and thus assisted him in giving birth to Athena, for Hephaestus is there
                  represented as older than Athena. A further development of the later tradition is,
                  that Hephaestus sprang from the thigh of Hera, and, being for a long time kept in
                  ignorance of his parentage, he at length had recourse to a stratagem, for the purpose
                  of finding it out. He constructed a chair, to which those who sat upon it were fastened,
                  and having thus entrapped Hera, he refused allowing her to rise until she had told
                  him who his parents were. (<span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 8.454</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Eclog.</span> 4.62.) For other accounts respecting his origin, see Cicero (<span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor.</span> 3.22), Pausanias (<span class="bibl">8.53.2</span>). and Eustathius (<span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 987</span>).
               </p> 
               <p>Hephaestus is the god of fire, especially in so far as it manifests itself as a power
                  of physical nature in volcanic districts, and in so far as it is the indispensable
                  means in arts and manufactures, whence fire is called the breath of Hephaestus, and
                  the name of the god is used both by Greek and Roman poets as synonymous with fire.
                  As a flame arises out of a little spark, so the god of fire was delicate and weakly
                  from his birth, for which reason he was so much disliked by his mother, that she wished
                  to get rid of him, and dropped him from Olympus. But the marine divinities, Thetis
                  and Eurynome, received him, and he dwelt with them for nine years in a grotto, surrounded
                  by Oceanus, making for them a variety of ornaments. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 18.394</span>, &amp;c.) It was, according to some accounts, during this period that he made the golden
                  chair by which he punished his mother for her want of affection, and from which he
                  would not release her, till he was prevailed upon by Dionysus. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 1.20.2</span>; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 166</span>.) Although Hephaestus afterwards remembered the cruelty of his mother, yet he was
                  always kind and obedient towards her, nay once, while she was quarrelling with Zeus,
                  he took her part, and thereby offended his father so much, that he seized him by the
                  leg, and hulled him down from Olympus. Hephaestus was a whole day falling, but in
                  the evening he came down in the island of Lemnos, where he was kindly received by
                  the Sintians. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 1.590</span>, &amp;c. <span class="bibl">V. Fl. 2.8.5</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.3.5</span>, who, however, confounds the two occasions on which Hephaestus was thrown from Olympus.)
                  Later writers describe his lameness as the consequence of his second fall, while Homer
                  makes him lame and weak from his birth. After his second fall he returned to Olympus,
                  and subsequently acted the part of mediator between his parents. (<span style="font-style: italic">Il</span> 1.585.) On that occasion he offered a cup of nectar to his mother and the other gods,
                  who burst out into immoderate laughter on seeing him busily hobbling through Olympus
                  from one god to another, for he was ugly and slow, and, owing to the weakness of his
                  legs, he was held up, when he walked, by artificial supports, skilfully made of gold.
                  (<span class="bibl">Il. 18.410</span>, &amp;c., <span class="bibl">Od. 8.311</span>, <span class="bibl">330</span>.) Iis neck and chest, however, were strong and muscular. (<span class="bibl">Il. 18.415</span>, <span class="bibl">20.36</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>In Olympus, Hephaestus had his own palace, imperishable and shining like stars: it
                  contained his workshop, with the anvil, and twenty bellows, which worked spontaneously
                  at his bidding. (<span class="bibl">Il. 18.370</span>, &amp;c.) It was there that he made all his beautiful and marvellous works, utensils,
                  and arms, both for gods and men. The ancient poets and mythographers abound in passages
                  describing works of exquisite workmanship which had been manufactured by Hephaestus.
                  In later accounts, the Cyclopes, Brontes, Steropes, Pyracmon, and others, are his
                  workmen and servants, and his workshop is no longer represented as in Olympus, but
                  in the interior of some volcanic isle. (<span class="bibl">Verg. A. 8.416</span>, &amp;c.) The wife of Hephaestus also lived in his palace: in the Iliad she is called
                  a Charis, in the Odyssey Aphrodite (<span class="bibl">Il. 18.382</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 8.270</span>), and in Hesiod's Theogony (945) she is named Aglaia. the youngest of the Charites.
                  The story of Aphrodite's faithlessness to her husband, and of the manner in which
                  he surprised her, is exquisitely described in <span class="bibl">Od. 8.266</span>_<span class="bibl">358</span>. The Homeric poems do not mention any descendants of Hephaestus, but in later writers
                  the number of his children is considerable. In the Trojan war he was on the side of
                  the Greeks, but he was also worshipped by the Trojans, and on one occasion he saved
                  a Trojan from being killed by Diomedes. (<span class="bibl">Il. 5.9</span>, &amp;c.)
               </p> 
               <p>His favourite place on earth was the island of Lemnos, where he liked to dwell among
                  the Sintians (<span class="bibl">Od. 8.283</span>, &amp;c., <span class="bibl">Il. 1.593</span>; <span style="font-style: italic">Ov Fast.</span> 8.82); but other volcanic islands also, such as Lipara, Hiera, Imbros. and Sicily,
                  are called his abodes or workshops. (Apollon. Rhod 3.41; Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Dian.</span> 47; <span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 8.416</span>; Strab. p. 275; <span class="bibl">Plin. Nat. 3.9</span>; Val. Flace. 2.96.)
               </p> 
               <p>Hephaestus is among the male what Athena is among the female deities, for, like her,
                  he give skill to mortal artists, and, conjointly with her, he was believed to have
                  taught men the arts which embellish and adorn life. (<span class="bibl">Od. 6.233</span>, <span class="bibl">23.160</span>. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Vaulc.</span> 2. &amp;c.) But he was. nevertheless, conceived as far inferior to the sublime character
                  of Athena. At Athens they had temples and festivals in common. (See <span style="font-style: italic">Dict of Ant. s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἡφαιστεῖα</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Χαλκεῖα</span>.) Both also were believed to have great healing powers, and Lemnian earth (terra
                  Lemnia) from the spot on which Hephaestus had falleen was believed to cure madness,
                  the bites of snakes, and haemorrhage, and the priests of the god knew how to cure
                  wounds inflicted by snakes. (Philostr. <span style="font-style: italic">Heroic.</span> 5.2; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 330</span>; Dict. Cret. 2.14.) The epithets and surnames by which Hephaestus is designated by
                  the poets generally allude to his skill in the plastic arts or to his figure and his
                  lameness. He was represented in the temple of Athena Chalcioecus at Sparta, in the
                  act of delivering his mother (<span class="bibl">Paus. 3.17.3</span>); on the chest of Cypselus, giving to Thetis the armour for Achilles (5.19.2); and
                  at Athens there was the famous statue of Hephaestus by Alcamenes, in which his lameness
                  was slightly indicated. (Cic. <span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor.</span> 1.30; <span class="bibl">V. Max. 8.11.3</span>.) The Greeks frequently placed small dwarf-like statues of the god near the hearth,
                  and these dwarfish figures seem to have been the most ancient. (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 3.37</span>; <span class="bibl">Aristoph. Birds 436</span>; Callim. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymnn. in Dian.</span> 60.) During the best period of Grecian art, he was represented as a vigorous man
                  with a beard, and is characterised by his hammer or some other instrument, his oval
                  cap, and the chiton, which leaves the right shoulder and arm uncovered. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e255">[Page 385]</span> (Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> 1.42, &amp;c.) The Romans, when speaking of the Greek Hephaestus, call him Vulcanus,
                  although Vulcanus was an original Italian divinity. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">VULCANUS.</span>]
