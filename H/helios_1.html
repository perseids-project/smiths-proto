              <div id="smith-bio">helios-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="persName">Ἥλιος</span> or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἠέλιος</span>), that is, the sun, or the god of the sun. He is described as the son of Hyperion
                  and Theia, and as a brother of Selene and Eos. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 12.176</span>, <span class="bibl">322</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Min.</span> 9, 13; <span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 371</span>, &amp;c.) From his father, he is frequently called Hyperionides, or Hyperion, the latter
                  of which is an abridged form of the patronymic, Hyperionion. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 12.176</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Cer.</span> 74; <span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 1011</span>; Hom. (<span class="bibl">Od. 1.24</span>, <span class="bibl">2.19</span>, <span class="bibl">398</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Apoll. Pyth.</span> 191.) In the Homeric hymn on Helios, he is called a son of Hyperion and Euryphaessa.
                  Homer describes Helios as giving light both to gods and men: he rises in the east
                  from Oceanus, though not from the river, but from some lake or bog (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">λίμνη</span>) formed by Oceanus, rises up into heaven, where he reaches the highest point at noon
                  time, and then he descends, arriving in the evening in the darkness of the west, and
                  in Oceanus. (<span class="bibl">Il. 7.422</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 3.1</span>, &amp;c., 335, 4.400, 10.191, 11.18, 12.380.) Later poets have marvellously embellished
                  this simple notion: they tell of a most magnificent palace of Helios in the east,
                  containing a throne occupied by the god, and surrounded by personifications of the
                  different divisions of time (<span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 2.1</span>, &amp;c.); and while Homer speaks only of the gates of Helios in the west, later writers
                  assign to him a second palace in the west, and describe his horses as feeding upon
                  herbs growing in the islands of the blessed. (Nonn. <span style="font-style: italic">Dionys.</span> 12.1, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Ath. 7.296</span>; <span class="bibl">Stat. Theb. 3.407</span>.) The points at which Helios rises and descends into the ocean are of course different
                  at the different seasons of the year; and the extreme points in the north and south,
                  between which the rising and setting take place, are the <span lang="grc" class="foreign">τροπαὶ ἠελίοιο</span>. (<span class="bibl">Od. 15.403</span>; Hes. <span style="font-style: italic">Op. et Dies,</span> 449, 525.) The manner in which Helios during the night passes front the western into
                  the eastern ocean is not mentioned either by Homer or Hesiod, but later poets make
                  him sail in a golden boat round one-half of the earth, and thus arrive in the east
                  at the point from which he has to rise again. This golden boat is the work of Hephaestus.
                  (<span class="bibl">Ath. 11.469</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.5.10</span>; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1632</span>.) Others represent him as making his nightly voyage while slumbering in a golden
                  bed. (<span class="bibl">Ath. 11.470</span>.) The horses and chariot with which Helios makes his daily career are not mentioned
                  in the Iliad and Odyssey, but first occur in the Homeric hymn on Helios (9, 15; comp.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">in Merc.</span> 69, <span style="font-style: italic">in Cer.</span> 88), and both are described minutely by later poets. (<span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 2.106</span>, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 183</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Eurip. Pholen.</span> 3 ; <span class="bibl">Pind. O. 7.71</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>Helios is described even in the Homeric poems as the god who sees and hears every
                  thing, but, notwithstanding this, he is unaware of the fact that the companions of
                  Odysseus robbed his oxen, until he was informed of it by Lampetia. (<span class="bibl">Od. 12.375</span>.) But, owing to his omniscience, he was able to betray to Hephaestus the faithlessness
                  of Aphrodite, and to reveal to Demeter the carrying off of her daughter. (<span class="bibl">Od. 8.271</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Cer. 75,</span> &amp;c., <span style="font-style: italic">in Sol.</span> 10; comp. Soph. <span style="font-style: italic">Ajax,</span> 847, &amp;c.) This idea of Helios knowing every thing, which also contains the elements
                  of his ethical and prophetic nature, seems to have been the cause of Helios being
                  confounded and identified with Apollo, though they were originally quite distinct;
                  and the identification was, in fact, never carried out completely, for no Greek poet
                  ever made Apollo ride in the chariot of Helios through the heavens, and among the
                  Romans we find this idea only after the time of Virgil. The representations of Apollo
                  with rays around his head, to characterise him as identical with the sun, belong to
                  the time of the Roman empire.
               </p> 
               <p>The island of Thrinacia (Sicily) was sacred to Helios, and he there had flocks of
                  oxen and sheep, each consisting of 350 heads, which never increased or decreased,
                  and were attended to by his daughters Phaetusa and Lampetia. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 12.128. 261</span>, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 4.965</span>, &amp;c.) Later traditions ascribe to him flocks also in the island of Erytheia (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.6.1</span>; comp. 2.5.10 ; Theocrit. 25.130), and it may be remarked in general, that sacred
                  flocks, especially of oxen, occur in most places where the worship of Helios was established.
                  His descendants are very numerous, and the surnames and epithets given him by the
                  poets are mostly descriptive of his character as the sun. Temples of Helios (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ήλιεῖα</span>) seem to have existed in Greece at a very early time (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 12.346</span>), and in later times we find his worship <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e220">[Page 376]</span> established in various places, as in Elis (

               <div class="biblfree">Paus. 6.25.5</div>

               <p>), Hermione (</p>
               <div class="biblfree">Paus. 2.34.10</div>
               <p>), in the acropolis of Corinth (2.4.7; comp. 2.1.6), near Argos (2.18.3), at Troezene
                  (2.31.8), Megalopolis (8.9.2, 31.4), and several other places, especially in the island
                  of Rhodes, where the famous colossus of Rhodes was a representation of Helios: it
                  was 70 cubits in height, and, being overthrown by an earthquake, the Rhodians were
                  commanded by an oracle not to erect it again. (

               <div class="biblfree">Pind. O. 7.54</div>

               <p>.) The sacrifices offered to Helios consisted of white rams, boars, bulls, goats,
                  Lambs, especially white horses, and honey. (
               </p>

                  (<span class="bibl">Paus. 5.25.5</span>.) The Roman poets, when speaking of the god of the sun (Sol), usually adopt the notions
                  of the Greeks, but the worship of Sol was introduced also at Rome, especially after
                  the Romans had become acquainted with the East, though traces of the worship of the
                  sun and moon occur at a very early period. (Varro, <span style="font-style: italic">de Ling. Lat.</span> 5.74; <span class="bibl">Dionys. A. R. 2.50</span>; Sext. Ruf. <span style="font-style: italic">Reg. Urb.</span> iv.) Helios was represented on the pedestal of the Olympian Zeus, in the act of ascending
                  his chariot (<span class="bibl">Paus. 5.11.3</span>), and several statutes of him are mentioned (6.24.5, 8.9.2, 31.4); he was also represented
                  riding in his chariot, drawn by four horses. (<span class="bibl">Plin. Nat. 34.3</span>, <span class="bibl">19</span>; comp. Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> 1.35.)
