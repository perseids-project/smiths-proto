               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="persName">Ἥρα</span> or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἥρη</span>), probably identical with <span style="font-style: italic">kera,</span> mistress, just as her husband, Zeus, was called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἔρρος</span> in the Aeolian dialect (Hesych. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span>). The derivation of the name has been attempted in a variety of ways, from Greek
                  as well as oriental roots, though there is no reason for having recourse to the latter,
                  as Hera is a purely Greek divinity, and one of the few who, according to Herodotus
                  (<span class="bibl">2.50</span>), were not introduced into Greece from Egypt. Hera was, according to some accounts,
                  the eldest daughter of Cronos and Rhea, and a sister of Zeus. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 16.432</span>; comp. 4.58; <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 6.29</span>.) Apollodorus (<span class="bibl">1.1.5</span>), however, calls Hestia the eldest daughter of Cronos; and Lactantius (1.14) calls
                  her a twin-sister of Zeus. According to the Homeric poems (<span class="bibl">Il. 14.201</span>, &amp;c.), she was brought up by Oceanus and Thetys, as Zeus had usurped the throne of
                  Cronos; and afterwards she became the wife of Zeus, without the knowledge of her parents.
                  This simple account is variously modified in other traditions. Being a daughter of
                  Cronos, she, like his other children, was swallowed by her father, but afterwards
                  released (Apollod. <span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span>), and, according to an Arcadian tradition, she was brought up by Temenus, the son
                  of Pelasgus. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.22.2</span>; August. <span style="font-style: italic">de Civ. Dei,</span> 6.10.) The Argives, on the other hand, related that she had been brought up by Euboea,
                  Prosymna, and Acraea, the three daughters of the river Asterion (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.7.1</span>, &amp;c.; Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Sympos.</span> 3.9); and according to Olen, the Horae were her nurses. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.13.3</span>.) Several parts of Greece also claimed the honour of being her birthplace; among
                  them are two, Argos and Samos, which were the principal seats of her worship. (Strab.
                  p. 413; <span class="bibl">Paus. 7.4.7</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 1.187</span>.) Her marriage with Zeus also offered ample scope for poetical invention (Theocrit.
                  17.131, &amp;c.), and several places in Greece claimed the honour of having been the scene
                  of the marriage, such as Euboea (Steph. Byz. <span style="font-style: italic">s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Κάρυστος</span>), Samos (Lactant. <span style="font-style: italic">de Fals. Relig.</span> 1.17), Cnossus in Crete (<span class="bibl">Diod. 5.72</span>), and Mount Thornax, in the south of Argolis. (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Theocrit.</span> 15.64; <span class="bibl">Paus. 2.17.4</span>, <span class="bibl">36.2</span>.) This marriage acts a prominent part in the worship of Hera under the name of <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἱερὸς γάμος</span>; on that occasion all the gods honoured the bride with presents, and Ge presented
                  to her a tree with golden apples, which was watched by the Hesperides in the garden
                  of Hera, at the foot of the Hyperborean Atlas. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.5.11</span>; <span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 4.484</span>.) The Homeric poems know nothing of all this, and we only hear, that after the marriage
                  with Zeus, she was treated by the Olympian gods with the same reverence as her husband.
                  (<span class="bibl">Il. 15.85</span>, &amp;c.; comp. 1.532, &amp;c., 4.60, &amp;c.) Zeus himself, according to Homer, listened to
                  her counsels, and communicated his secrets to her rather than to other gods (16.458,
                  1.547). Hera also thinks herself justified in censuring Zeus when he consults others
                  without her knowing it (1.540, &amp;c.); but she is, notwithstanding, far inferior to
                  him in power; she must obey him unconditionally, and, like the other gods, she is
                  chastised by him when she has offended him (4.56, 8.427, 463). Hera therefore is not,
                  like Zeus, the queen of gods and men, but simply the wife of the supreme god. The
                  idea of her being the queen of heaven, with regal wealth and power, is of a much later
                  date. (<span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 92</span>; <span class="bibl">Ov. Fast. 6.27</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Heroid.</span> 16.81; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 81</span>.) There is only one point in which the Homeric poems represent Hera as possessed
                  of similar power with Zeus, viz. she is able to confer the power of prophecy (19.407).
                  But this idea is not further developed in later times. (Comp. Strab. p. 380; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 3.931</span>.) Her character, as described by Homer, is not of a very amiable kind, and its main
                  features are jealousy, obstinacy, and a quarrelling disposition, which sometimes makes
                  her own husband tremble (1.522, 536, 561, 5.892.) Hence there arise frequent disputes
                  between Hera and Zeus; and on one occasion Hera, in conjunction with Poseidon and
                  Athena, contemplated putting Zeus into chains (8.408, 1.399). Zeus, in such cases,
                  not only threatens, but beats her; and once he even hung her up in the clouds, her
                  hands chained, and with two anvils suspended from her feet (8.400, &amp;c., 477, 15.17,
                  &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1003</span>). Hence she is frightened by his threats, and gives way when he is angry; and when
                  she is unable to gain her ends in any other way, she has recourse to cunning and intrigues
                  (19.97). Thus she borrowed from Aphrodite the girdle, the giver of charm and fascination,
                  to excite the love of Zeus (14.215, &amp;c.). By Zeus she was the mother of Ares, Hebe,
                  and Hephaestus (5.896, <span class="bibl">Od. 11.604</span>, <span class="bibl">Il. 1.585</span>; <span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 921</span>, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.3.1</span>.) Respecting the different traditions about the descent of these three divinities
                  see the separate articles.
               </p> 
               <p>Properly speaking, Hera was the only really married goddess among the Olympians, for
                  the marriage of Aphrodite with Ares can scarcely be taken into consideration; and
                  hence she is the goddess of marriage and of the birth of children. Several epithets
                  and surnames, such as <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Εἰγείθυια</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Γαμηλία</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ζυλία</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Τελεία</span>, &amp;c., contain allusions to this character of the goddess, and the Eileithyiae are
                  described as her daughters. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 11.271</span>, <span class="bibl">19.118</span>.) Her attire is described in the Iliad (<span class="bibl">14.170</span>, &amp;c.); she rode in a chariot drawn by two horses, in the harnessing and unharnessing
                  of which she was assisted by Hebe and the Horase (4.27, 5.720, &amp;c., 8.382, 433). Her
                  favourite places on earth were Argos, Sparta, and Mycenae (4.51). Owing to the judgment
                  of Paris, she was hostile towards the Trojans, and in the Trojan war she accordingly
                  sided with the Greeks (2.15, 4.21, &amp;c., 24.519, &amp;c.). Hence she prevailed on Helius
                  to sink down into the waves of Oceanus on the day on which Patroclus fell (18.239).
                  In the Iliad she appears as an enemy of Heracles, but is wounded by his arrows (5.392,
                  18.118), and in the Odyssey she is described as the supporter of Jason. It is impossible
                  here to enumerate all the events of mythical story in which Hera acts a more or less
                  prominent part; and the reader must refer to the particular deities or heroes with
                  whose story she is connected.
               </p> 
               <p>Hera had sanctuaries, and was worshipped in many parts of Greece, often in common
                  with Zeus. Her worship there may be traced to the very earliest times: thus we find
                  Hera, surnamed Pelasgis, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e242">[Page 386]</span> worshipped at Iolcos. But the principal place of her worship was Argos, hence called
                  the <span lang="grc" class="foreign">δώ̀μα Ἡρας</span>. (Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">Nem.</span> x. imt.; comp. Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Suppl.</span> 297.) According to tradition, Hera had disputed the possession of Argos with Poseidon,
                  but the river-gods of the country adjudicated it to her. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.15.5</span>.) Her most celebrated sanctuary was situated between Argos and Mycenae, at the foot
                  of Mount Euboea. The vestibule of the temple contained ancient statues of the Charites,
                  the bed of Hera, and a shield which Menelaus had taken at Troy from Euphorbus. The
                  sitting colossal statue of Hera in this temple, made of gold and ivory, was the work
                  of Polycletus. She wore a crown on her head, adorned with the Charites and Horae;
                  in the one hand she held a pomegranate, and in the other a sceptre headed with a cuckoo.
                  (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.17</span>, <span class="bibl">22</span>; Strab. p. 373; <span class="bibl">Stat. Theb. 1.383</span>.) Respecting the great quinqnennial festival celebrated to her at Argos, see <span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s. v.</span> <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἤραια</span>. Her worship was very ancient also at Corinth (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.24</span>, <span class="bibl">1</span>, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.9.28</span>), Sparta (3.13.6, 15.7), in Samos (<span class="bibl">Hdt. 3.60</span>; <span class="bibl">Paus. 7.4.4</span>; Strab. p. 637), at Sicyon (<span class="bibl">Paus. 2.11.2</span>), Olympia (5.15.7, &amp;c.), Epidaurus (<span class="bibl">Thuc. 5.75</span>; <span class="bibl">Paus. 2.29.1</span>), Heraea in Arcadia (<span class="bibl">Paus. 8.26.2</span>), and many other places.
               </p> 
               <p>Respecting the real significance of Hera, the ancients themselves offer several interpretations:
                  some regarded her as the personification of the atmosphere (<span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 1.51</span>), others as the queen of heaven or the goddess of the stars (<span class="bibl">Eur. Hel. 1097</span>), or as the goddess of the moon (Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Quaest. Rom.</span> 74), and she is even confounded with Ceres, Diana, and Proserpina. (Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Georg.</span> 1.5). According to modern views, Hera is the great goddess of nature, who was every
                  where worshipped from the earliest times. The Romans identified their goddess Juno
                  with the Greek Hera [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">JUNO</span>]. We still possess several representations of Hera. The noblest image, and which
                  was afterwards looked upon as the ideal of the goddess, was the statue by Polycletus.
                  She was usually represented as a majestic woman at a mature age, with a beautiful
                  forehead, large and widely opened eyes, and with a grave expression commanding reverence.
                  Her hair was adorned with a crown or a diadem. A veil frequently hangs down the back
                  of her head, to characterise her as the bride of Zeus, and, in fact, the diadem, veil,
                  sceptre, and peacock are her ordinary attributes. A number of statues and heads of
                  Hera still exist. (Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> i. p. 22; comp. Muller, <span style="font-style: italic">Dorians,</span> 2.10.1.)
