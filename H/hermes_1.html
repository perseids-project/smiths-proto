<div id="smith-bio">hermes-bio-1</div>
               <p><span lang="grc" class="persName">Ἑρμῆς</span>, (<span lang="grc" class="persName">Ἑρμείας</span>, Dor. <span lang="grc" class="label">Ἑρμᾶς</span>), a son of Zeus and Maia, the daughter of Atlas, was born in a cave of Mount Cyllene
                  in Arcadia (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 8.335</span>, <span class="bibl">14.435</span>, <span class="bibl">24.1</span>; <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Merc.</span> 1, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 1.682</span>, <span class="bibl">14.291</span>), whence he is called Atlantiades or Cyllenius; but Philostratus (<span style="font-style: italic">Icon.</span> 1.26) places his birth in Olympus. In the first hours after his birth, he escaped
                  from his cradle, went to Pieiria, and carried off some of the oxen of Apollo. (Hom.
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Merc.</span> 17.) In the Iliad and Odyssey this tradition is not mentioned, though Hermes is characterised
                  as a cunning thief. (<span class="bibl">Il. 5.390</span>, <span class="bibl">24.24</span>.) Other accounts, again, refer the theft of the oxen to a more advanced period of
                  the life of the god. (Apollod. iii. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e123">[Page 412]</span> 10.2; 
               </p>
               <div class="biblfree">Ant. Lib. 23</div>
               <p>.) In order not to be discovered by the traces of his footsteps, Hermes put on sandals,
                  and drove the oxen to Pylos, where he killed two, and concealed the rest in a cave.
                  (Comp. the different stratagems by which he escaped in Horn. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Merc.</span> 75, &amp;c., and Anton. Lib. <span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span>) The skins of the slaughtered animals were nailed to a rock, and part of their flesh
                  was prepared and consumed, and the rest burnt; at the same time he offered scrifices
                  to the twelve gods, whence he is probably called the inventor of divine worship and
                  sacrifices. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Merc.</span> 125, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Diod. 1.16</span>.) Hereupon he returned to Cyllene, where he found a tortoise at the entrance of his
                  native cave. He took the animal's shell, drew strings across it, and thus invented
                  the lyre and plectrum. The number of strings of his new invention is said by some
                  to have been three and by others seven, and they were made of the guts either of oxen
                  or of sheep. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span> 51; <span class="bibl">Diod. 1.16</span>, <span class="bibl">5.75</span>; Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Argon.</span> 381; <span class="bibl">Hor. Carm. 1.10</span>. 6.) Apollo, by his prophetic power, had in the meantime discovered the thief, and
                  went to Cyllene to charge him with it before his mother Maia. She showed to the god
                  the child in its cradle; but Apollo took the boy before Zeus, and demanded back his
                  oxen. Zeus commanded him to comply with the demand of Apollo, but Hermes denied that
                  he had stolen the cattle. As, however, he saw that his assertions were not believed,
                  he conducted Apollo to Pylos, and restored to him his oxen; but when Apollo heard
                  the sounds of the lyre, he was so charmed that he allowed Hermes to keep the animals.
                  Hermes now invented the syrinx, and after having disclosed his inventions to Apollo,
                  the two gods concluded an intimate friendship with each other. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span> 514, &amp;c.) Apollo presented his young friend with his own golden shepherd's staff,
                  taught him the art of prophesying by means of dice, and Zeus made him his own herald,
                  and also of the gods of the lower world. According to the Homeric hymn (533, &amp;c.),
                  Apollo refused to teach Hermes the art of prophecy, and referred him for it to the
                  three sisters dwelling on Parnassus; but he conferred upon him the office of protecting
                  flocks and pastures (568; comp. Lucian, <span style="font-style: italic">Dial. Deor.</span> 7; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 2.683</span>, &amp;c.).
               </p> 
               <p>The principal feature in the traditions about Hermes consists in his being the herald
                  of the gods, and in this capacity he appears even in the Homeric poems; his original
                  character of an ancient Pelasgian, or Arcadian divinity of nature, gradually disappeared
                  in the legends. As the herald of the gods, he is the god of skill in the use of speech
                  and of eloquence in general, for the heralds are the public speakers in the assemblies
                  and on other occasions. (<span class="bibl">Il. 1.333</span>, <span class="bibl">4.193</span>, <span class="bibl">7.279</span>, <span class="bibl">385</span>, <span class="bibl">8.517</span>, <span class="bibl">11.684</span>; comp. Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 27. 4; Aelian, <span class="bibl">Ael. NA 10.29</span>; <span class="bibl">Hor. Carm. 1.10</span>. 1.) As an adroit speaker, he was especially employed as messenger, when eloquence
                  was required to attain the desired object. (<span class="bibl">Od. 1.38</span>, <span class="bibl">Il. 24.390</span>; Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Cer.</span> 335.) Hence the tongues of sacrificial animals were offered to him. (<span class="bibl">Aristoph. Peace 1062</span>; <span class="bibl">Athen. 1.16</span>.) As heralds and messengers are usually men of prudence and circumspection, Hermes
                  was also the god of prudence and skill in all the relations of social intercourse.
                  (<span class="bibl">Il. 20.35</span>, <span class="bibl">24.282</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 2.38</span>.) These qualities were combined with similar ones, such as cunning both in words
                  and actions, and even fraud, perjury, and the inclination to steal; but acts of this
                  kind were committed by Hermes always with a certain skill, dexterity, and even gracefulness.
                  Examples occur in the Homeric hymn on Hermes (66, 260, 383; comp. <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1337</span>; <span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 5.390</span>, <span class="bibl">24.24</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.6.3</span>).
               </p> 
               <p>Being endowed with this shrewdness and sagacity, he was regarded as the author of
                  a variety of inventions, and, besides the lyre and syrinx, he is said to have invented
                  the alphabet, numbers, astronomy, music, the art of fighting, gymnastics, the cultivation
                  of the olive tree, measures, weights, and many other things. (Plut. <span style="font-style: italic">Sympos.</span> 9.3; Diod. <span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span> and 5.75; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 277</span>.) The powers which he possessed himself he conferred upon those mortals and heroes
                  who enjoyed his favour, and all who had them were under his especial protection, or
                  are called his sons. (<span style="font-style: italic">Od. x.</span> 277, &amp;c., 15.318, &amp;c., 19.397; Soph. <span style="font-style: italic">Philoct.</span> 133; Hes. <span style="font-style: italic">Op.</span> 67; Eustath. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Hom.</span> pp. 18, 1053.) He was employed by the gods and more especially by Zeus on a variety
                  of occasions which are recorded in ancient story. Thus he conducted Priam to Achilles
                  to fetch the body of Hector (<span class="bibl">Il. 24.336</span>), tied Ixion to the wheel (<span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 62</span>), conducted Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena to Paris (<span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 92</span>; <span class="bibl">Paus. 5.19.1</span>), fastened Prometheus to Mount Caucasus (Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Eclog.</span> 6.42), rescued Dionysus after his birth from the flames, or received him from the
                  hands of Zeus to carry him to Athamas (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.4.3</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 4.1137</span>), sold Heracles to Omphale (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.6.3</span>), and was ordered by Zeus to carry off Io, who was metamorphosed into a cow, and
                  guarded by Argus; but being betrayed by Hierax, he slew Argus. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 2.1.3</span>.) From this murder he is very commonly called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἀργειφόντης</span>. (<span class="bibl">Il. 24.182</span>; comp. Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Aeschyl. Prom.</span> 563; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 1.670</span>, &amp;c.) In the Trojan war Hermes was on the side of the Greeks. (<span class="bibl">Il. 20.72</span>, &amp;c.) His ministry to Zeus is not confined to the offices of herald and messenger,
                  but he is also the charioteer and cupbearer. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 1.143</span>, <span class="bibl">Il. 24.178</span>, <span class="bibl">440</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Cer.</span> 380; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1205</span>.) As dreams are sent by Zeus, Hermes, the <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἡγήτωρ ὀνείρων</span>, conducts them to man, and hence he is also described as the god who had it in his
                  power to send refreshing sleep or to take it away. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Merc.</span> 14, <span class="bibl">Il. 2.26</span>, <span class="bibl">24.343</span>, &amp;c.) Another important function of Hermes was to conduct the shades of the dead
                  from the upper into the lower world, whence he is called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ψυχοπομπός</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">νεκροπομτός</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ψυχαγωγός</span>, &amp;c. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 24.1</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">9, Hymn. in Cer.</span> 379, &amp;c.; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 561</span>; <span class="bibl">D. L. 8.31</span>; <span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 251</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>The idea of his being the herald and messenger of the gods, of his travelling from
                  place to place and concluding treaties, necessarily implied the notion that he was
                  the promoter of social intercourse and of commerce among men, and that he was friendly
                  towards man. (<span class="bibl">Od. 19.135</span>, <span class="bibl">Il. 24.333</span>.) In this capacity he was regarded as the maintainer of peace, and as the god of
                  roads, who protected travellers, and punished those who refused to assist travellers
                  who had mistaken their way. (<span class="bibl">Il. 7.277</span>, &amp;c.; Theocrit. 25.5; <span class="bibl">Aristoph. Pl. 1159</span>.) Hence the Athenian generals, on setting out on an expedition, offered sacrifices
                  to Hermas, surnamed Hegemonius, or Agetor; and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d32e373">[Page 413]</span> numerous statues of the god were erected on roads, at doors and gates, from which
                  circumstance he derived a variety of surnames and epithets. As the god of commerce,
                  he was called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">διέμπορος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἐμπολαῖος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">παλιγκάπηλος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">κερδέμπορος</span>, <span lang="grc" class="foreign">ἀγοραῖος</span>, &amp;c. (<span class="bibl">Aristoph. Pl. 1155</span>; Pollux, 7.15; Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 27.6; <span class="bibl">Paus. 1.15.1</span>, <span class="bibl">2.9</span>. §. 7, 3.11.8, &amp;c.); and as commerce is the source of wealth, Hermes is also the
                  god of gain and riches, especially of sudden and unexpected riches, such as are acquired
                  by commerce. As the giver of wealth and good luck (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">πλουτοδότης</span>), he also presided over the game of dice, and those who played it threw an olive
                  leaf upon the dice, and first drew this leaf. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 7.183</span>; <span class="bibl">Aristoph. Peace 365</span>; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 675</span>.) We have already observed that Hermes was considered as the inventor of sacrifices,
                  and hence he not only acts the part of a herald at sacrifices (<span class="bibl">Aristoph. Peace 433</span>), but is also the protector of sacrificial animals, and was believed in particular
                  to increase the fertility of sheep. (Hom. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Merc.</span> 567, &amp;c., <span class="bibl">Il. 14.490</span>, <span class="bibl">16.180</span>, &amp;c; <span class="bibl">Hes. Th. 444</span>.) For this reason he was especially worshipped by shepherds, and is mentioned in
                  connection with Pan and the Nymphs. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 14.435</span>; <span class="bibl">Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1766</span>; <span class="bibl">Aristoph. Thes. 977</span>; <span class="bibl">Paus. 8.16.1</span>; <span class="bibl">9.34.2</span>; Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Soph. Philoct.</span> 14, 59.) This feature in the character of Hermes is a remnant of the ancient Arcadian
                  religion, in which he was the fertilising god of the earth, who conferred his blessings
                  on man; and some other traces of this character occur in the Homeric poems. (<span class="bibl">Il. 24.360</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 8.335</span>, <span class="bibl">16.185</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn. in Merc.</span> 27.)
               </p> 
               <p>Another important function of Hermes was his being the patron of all the gymnastic
                  games of the Greeks. This idea seems to be of late origin, for in the Homeric poems
                  no trace of it is found; and the appearance of the god, such as it is there described,
                  is very different from that which we might expect in the god of the gymnastic art.
                  But as his images were erected in so many places, and among them, at the entrance
                  of the gymnasia, the natural result was, that he, like Heracles and the Dioscuri,
                  was regarded as the protector of youths and gymnastic exercises and contests (<span class="bibl">Pind. N. 10.53</span>), and that at a later time the Greek artists derived their ideal of the god from
                  the gymnasium, and represented him as a youth whose limbs were beautifully and harmoniously
                  developed by gymnastic exercises. Athens seems to have been the first place in which
                  he was worshipped in this capacity. (<span class="bibl">Pind. P. 2.10</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Isthm.</span> 1.60; <span class="bibl">Aristoph. Pl. 1161</span>.) The numerous descendants of Hermes are treated of in separate articles. It should
                  be observed that the various functions of the god led some of the ancients to assume
                  a plurality of gods of this name. Cicero (<span style="font-style: italic">de Nat. Deor.</span> 3.22) distinguishes five, and Servius (<span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 1.301</span>, <span class="bibl">4.577</span>) four; but these numbers also include foreign divinities, which were identified by
                  the Greeks with their own Hermes.
               </p> 
               <p>The most ancient seat of his worship is Arcadia, the land of his birth, where Lycaon,
                  the son of Pelasgus, is said to have built to him the first temple. (<span class="bibl">Hyg. Fab. 225</span>.) From thence his worship was carried to Athens, and ultimately spread through all
                  Greece. The festivals celebrated in his honour were called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">Ἕρμαια</span>. (<span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s, v.</span>) His temples and statues (<span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of Ant. s.v. Hermae</span>) were extremely numerous in Greece. The Romans identified him with Mercury. [<span style="font-variant: small-caps">MERCURIUS.</span>] Among the things sacred to him we may mention the palm tree, the tortoise, the number
                  four, and several kinds of fish; and the sacrifices offered to him consisted of incense,
                  honey, cakes, pigs, and especially lambs and young goats. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 7.22.2</span>; <span class="bibl">Aristoph. Pl. 1121</span>, <span class="bibl">1144</span>; <span class="bibl">Hom. Od. 14.435</span>, <span class="bibl">19.397</span>; <span class="bibl">Athen. 1.16</span>.)
               </p> 
               <p>The principal attributes of Hermes are: 1. A travelling hat, with a broad brim, which
                  in later times was adorned with two little wings; the latter, however, are sometimes
                  seen arising from his locks, his head not being covered with the hat. 2. The staff
                  (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">ῥάβδος</span> or <span lang="grc" class="foreign">σκῆπτρον</span>): it is frequently mentioned in the Homeric poems as the magic staff by means of
                  which he closes and opens the eyes of mortals, but no mention is made of the person
                  or god from whom he received it, nor of the entwining serpents which appear in late
                  works of art. According to the Homeric hymn and Apollodorus, he received it from Apollo;
                  and it appears that we must distinguish two staves, which were afterwards united into
                  one: first, the ordinary herald's staff (<span class="bibl">Il. 7.277</span>, <span class="bibl">18.505</span>), and secondly, a magic staff, such as other divinities also possessed. (Lucian,
                  <span style="font-style: italic">Dial. Deor.</span> 7.5; <span class="bibl">Verg. A. 4.242</span>, &amp;c.) The white ribbons with which the herald's staff was originally surrounded were
                  changed by later artists into two serpents (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Thuc.</span> 1.53; <span class="bibl">Macr. 1.19</span>; comp. Hygin. <span style="font-style: italic">Poet. Astr.</span> 2.7; <span class="bibl">Serv. ad Aen. 4.242</span>, <span class="bibl">8.138</span>), though the ancients themselves accounted for them either by tracing them to some
                  feat of the god, or by regarding them as symbolical representations of prudence, life,
                  health, and the like. The staff, in later times, is further adorned with a pair of
                  wings, expressing the rapidity with which the messenger of the gods moved from place
                  to place. 3. The sandals (<span lang="grc" class="foreign">πέδιλα</span>.) They were beautiful and golden, and carried the god across land and sea with the
                  rapidity of wind; but Homer no where says or suggests that they were provided with
                  wings. The plastic art, on the other hand, required some outward sign to express this
                  quality of the god's sandals, and therefore formed wings at his ancles, whence he
                  is called <span lang="grc" class="foreign">πτηνοπέδιλος</span>, or <span style="font-style: italic">alipes.</span> (Orph. <span style="font-style: italic">Hymn.</span> 27.4; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 11.312</span>.) In addition to these attributes, Hermes sometimes holds a purse in his hands. Several
                  representations of the god at different periods of his life, as well as in the discharge
                  of his different functions, have come down to us. (Hirt, <span style="font-style: italic">Mythol. Bilderb.</span> i. p. 63, &amp;c.)
