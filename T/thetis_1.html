<div id="smith-bio">thetis-bio-1</div>
               <p>(<span lang="grc" class="persName">Θέτις</span>), one of the daughters of Nereus and Doris, was the wife of Peleus, by whom she became
                  the mother of Achilles. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 1.538</span>, <span class="bibl">18.35</span>, &amp;c., 52, &amp;c.; Hes. <span style="font-style: italic">Theog. 244.</span>) Later writers describe her as a daughter of Cheiron (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Apollon. Rhod.</span> 1.558). According to others, Peleus married Philomela, the daughter of Actor, but
                  his friend Cheiron, wishing to render Peleus celebrated, spread the report that he
                  was married to Thetis. (Schol. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Apollon. Rhod.</span> 4.816.) Being a granddaughter of Poseidon, Catullus (<span class="bibl">64. 28</span>) calls her <span style="font-style: italic">Neptunine.</span> As a marine divinity, she dwelt like her sisters, the Nereids, in the depth of the
                  sea, with her father Nereus. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 1.358</span>, <span class="bibl">18.36</span>, <span class="bibl">20.207</span>.) She there received Dionysus on his flight from Lycurgus, and the god, in his gratitude,
                  presented her with a golden urn. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 6.135</span>, <span class="bibl">Od. 24.75</span>; comp. Tzetz. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Lycoph. 273.</span>) When Hephaestus was thrown down from heaven, he was likewise received by Thetis.
                  She had been brought up by Hera (<span class="bibl">Il. 24.60</span>), and when she reached the age of maturity, Zeus and Hera gave her, against her own
                  will, in marriage to Peleus. Poseidon and Zeus himself are said by some to have sued
                  for her hand (Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">Isthm.</span> 8.58), but when Themis declared that the son of Thetis would be more illustrious
                  than his father, both suitors desisted. (Pind. <span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span> 8.70; <span class="bibl">Ov. Met. 11.225</span>, <span class="bibl">15.856</span>, <span class="bibl">11.350</span>, &amp;c.; Aeschyl. <span style="font-style: italic">Prom. 767 ;</span> Hygin. <span style="font-style: italic">Fab. 54 ;</span> Serv. <span style="font-style: italic">ad Virg. Eclog.</span> 6.42.) Others state that Thetis rejected the offers of Zeus, because she had been
                  brought up by Hera (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 24.60</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollon. 4.793</span>); and the god, to revenge himself, decreed that she should marry a mortal. Cheiron
                  then informed his friend Peleus how he might gain possession of her, even if she should
                  metamorphose herself; for Thetis, like Proteus, had the power of assuming any form
                  she pleased, and she had recourse to this means of escaping from Peleus, but the latter
                  did not let her go, until she again assumed her proper form. (<span class="bibl">Apollod. 3.13.5</span>; <span class="bibl">Pind. N. 3.60</span>; <span class="bibl">Paus. 8.18</span>. § l.) Others again relate, that a marine divinity appeared to Peleus on Mount Pelion,
                  and testified her love to him, but without revealing herself to him. Peleus, however,
                  who saw her playing with dolphins, recognised the goddess, and henceforth shunned
                  her presence. But she encouraged him, reminding him of the love of Eos to Tithonus,
                  of Aphrodite to Anchises, &amp;c., and promised to present him with a son who should be
                  more illustrious than any mortal. (Philostr. <span style="font-style: italic">Her. 19. 1.</span>) The wedding of Pelens was honoured with the presence of all the gods. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 24.62</span>.) After she had become the mother of Achilles, she bestowed upon him the tenderest
                  care and love. (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 1.359</span>, <span class="bibl">500</span>, &amp;c., 8.370, 18.73, 457; comp. <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ACHILLES</span>.) Her prayers to Zeus for him were listened to, because at one time, when Zeus was
                  threatened by the other gods, she induced Briareus or Aegaeon to come to his assistance.
                  (<span class="bibl">Hom. Il. 1.396</span>, &amp;c.) Thetis had a temple (Thetideion) between Old and New Pharsalus in Thessaly
                  (<span class="bibl">Strab. ix. p.431</span>), and in Sparta and Messenia she was likewise worshipped. (<span class="bibl">Paus. 3.14.4</span>, <span class="bibl">22.2</span>.)
